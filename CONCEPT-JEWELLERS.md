# T2C — AML/CTF Compliance Guide for Jewellers & Dealers in Precious Metals, Stones and Products

## Product Concept Document — v1.0

---

## 1. Vision

**T2C** is a lightweight, static, single-page web application that guides Australian jewellers and dealers in precious metals, stones and products through their new Anti-Money Laundering / Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) obligations under the reformed AML/CTF Act (Tranche 2), effective **1 July 2026**.

It is **not** legal advice. It is a practical, step-by-step guidance tool built entirely from publicly available AUSTRAC materials, including the official **Jeweller Program Starter Kit** released 30 January 2026.

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Starter Kit Media Release](https://www.austrac.gov.au/news-and-media/media-release/austrac-backs-newly-regulated-sectors-release-amlctf-program-starter-kits) | [Dealers in Precious Metals, Stones and Products Guidance Hub](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance)

The tool mirrors the structure of AUSTRAC's own starter kit — **Customise → Implement → Maintain & Review** — but wraps it in an interactive, user-friendly interface with checklists, wizards, template forms, and plain-English explanations.

**Key AUSTRAC insight:** AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas stated that *"for most customers who are individuals posing a low to medium risk, compliance generally boils down to just three forms"* — onboarding, initial CDD, and ongoing monitoring. AUSTRAC has also developed a **streamlined compliance process** specifically for jewellers dealing with low-to-medium risk individual customers using physical currency.

**Who the starter kit is designed for:** The AUSTRAC starter kit is specifically designed for Tranche 2 entities who, from 1 July 2026, are for the first time subject to AML/CTF legislation. It is intended for typical small jewellery businesses. Larger or more complex dealers may need to supplement the starter kit with additional tailored compliance measures.

**Unique to jewellers — regulation options:** Unlike other Tranche 2 sectors, jewellers may be able to **avoid regulation entirely** by choosing not to accept physical currency or virtual assets for transactions of $10,000 or more. AUSTRAC provides 4 regulation options depending on your business model (see Section 3.4).

---

## 2. Problem Statement

From **1 July 2026**, businesses that buy or sell precious metals, stones or products for $10,000 or more in physical currency and/or virtual assets will be required to:

- Enrol with AUSTRAC as a reporting entity (within 28 days of providing a designated service — by **29 July 2026**)
- Develop and maintain an AML/CTF program (risk assessment, policies, processes)
- Appoint an AML/CTF compliance officer
- Conduct initial and ongoing customer due diligence (CDD)
- Screen for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS)
- Report suspicious matters (SMRs) and threshold transactions (TTRs) to AUSTRAC
- Conduct personnel due diligence on staff in AML/CTF roles
- Keep records for 7 years
- Train staff on ML/TF/PF risks and obligations
- Conduct internal reviews and independent evaluations (at least every 3 years)

Most small jewellers and precious goods dealers have **zero experience** with AML/CTF compliance. AUSTRAC's 2024 National Risk Assessment rated the **retail jewellery sector as a HIGH money laundering risk** in Australia. Precious metals and stones are among the most at-risk goods for money laundering because they can be bought anonymously with cash, are easy to conceal and transport, difficult to trace, and easy to convert back to legitimate funds.

**T2C bridges that gap** by translating AUSTRAC's requirements into plain-English, actionable guidance with interactive tools — all for free, with no data leaving the user's browser.

## 3. Who Is Regulated (and Who Is Not)

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Precious Metals, Stones and Products Services (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/before-you-start/new-industries-and-services-be-regulated-reform/precious-metals-stones-and-products-services-reform) | [Regulation Options for Dealers](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/regulation-options-dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products)

### 3.1 The Designated Service

The reforms capture **one category** of designated service for precious goods dealers:

| Designated Service | When It Applies |
|---|---|
| **Buying or selling precious metals, stones or products** — in the course of carrying on a business | When the purchase or sale: (1) is valued at **$10,000 or greater**, (2) involves a **single transaction or linked transactions**, and (3) is made using **physical currency, virtual assets, or a combination** at or above the $10,000 threshold |

**Critical distinction:** If these items are bought or sold using **only** a debit/credit card or bank transfer, the business is **NOT** providing a designated service.

### 3.2 What Are "Precious Metals, Stones and Products"?

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Precious Metals, Stones and Products Services (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/before-you-start/new-industries-and-services-be-regulated-reform/precious-metals-stones-and-products-services-reform)

| Category | Items Included |
|---|---|
| **Precious Metals** | Gold, silver, platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, or an alloy with at least 2% weight of any of these (manufactured or unmanufactured) |
| **Precious Stones** | Substances of gem quality with market-recognised beauty, rarity and value — including (not limited to): beryl, corundum, diamond, garnet, jadeite jade, opal, pearl, topaz. Applies whether synthetic, natural, or man-made. |
| **Precious Products** | Items made of, containing, or having attached precious metals or stones: jewellery, watches, items of personal adornment (belts, hair clips), goldsmith/silversmith wares (tableware, trophies, goblets, ornaments) |

**Determining if a substance is a precious stone:** Gem quality means colour, cut, clarity or carat can be assessed/graded. Beauty, rarity and value require the existence of a market for the substance.

**Note:** Bullion is a **separate** designated service regulated independently. This guidance does not cover bullion dealers.

### 3.3 What Is Exempt

| Scenario | Status |
|---|---|
| Sales paid entirely by bank transfer, debit card, or credit card | **Exempt** — not a designated service (no physical currency or virtual assets involved) |
| Sales under $10,000 in physical currency / virtual assets (with no linked transactions) | **Exempt** — below threshold |
| Costume jewellery with no precious metals or stones | **Exempt** — not a precious product |
| Bullion dealing | Regulated separately under bullion dealer designated services |
| Watch repair / jewellery repair only (no sales) | **Exempt** — not buying or selling precious products |

### 3.4 Regulation Options — UNIQUE TO JEWELLERS

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Regulation Options for Dealers in Precious Metals, Stones and Products](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/regulation-options-dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products)

AUSTRAC provides **four regulation options** depending on your business model:

| Option | Description | AML/CTF Obligations |
|---|---|---|
| **Option 1: Don't accept physical currency or virtual assets** | If you don't accept cash or crypto payments at all, you are **not regulated** | **None** — no AML/CTF program required |
| **Option 2: Accept cash/virtual assets under $10,000 per transaction** | You must monitor for linked or structured transactions that could exceed $10,000 | **Limited** — need clear policies and monitoring for linked transactions. If a $10,000+ transaction occurs, you must have a program or face penalties. |
| **Option 3: Accept cash/virtual assets but limit customer types** | Use AUSTRAC's **streamlined compliance process** for low/medium risk individual customers only | **Streamlined** — refer physical currency transactions to store owner/manager who follows simplified process |
| **Option 4: Accept cash/virtual assets from all customer types** | Full AML/CTF program required for wider range of customers including entities, high-risk, foreign | **Full** — implement complete AML/CTF program using starter kit |

**Interactive Decision Aid:** The tool should include a wizard that helps jewellers determine which option applies to their business and what level of compliance they need.

### 3.5 Linked Transactions

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Precious Metals, Stones and Products Services (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/before-you-start/new-industries-and-services-be-regulated-reform/precious-metals-stones-and-products-services-reform)

The $10,000 threshold applies not just to single transactions but to **transactions that are linked or appear to be linked**.

**Examples of linked transactions:**
- A customer deliberately splits a larger transaction into smaller payments below $10,000 to avoid AML/CTF obligations (**structuring — this is a criminal offence**)
- Multiple payments made under a single invoice
- A single payment made for multiple invoices
- Payments made on the same date
- Lay-by payments or instalments

**Instalment example from AUSTRAC:**
A customer purchases a single item worth $15,000 and pays in three instalments:
- Day 1: $5,000 in cash
- Day 2: $5,000 in cash
- Day 3: $5,000 in virtual assets

Each transaction is under $10,000, but they are linked — the business begins providing a designated service on **Day 2** (when cumulative value exceeds $10,000).

**Mixed transactions:** If a transaction includes both regulated items (precious products) and unregulated items (e.g., leather shoes), only the regulated items count towards the $10,000 threshold.

## 4. Target Users

| User Persona | Description |
|---|---|
| **Jewellery Shop Owner / Principal** | Needs to understand overall obligations, choose regulation option, set up AML/CTF program, and appoint a compliance officer |
| **Sales Staff / Counter Staff** | Needs to know when a transaction triggers AML/CTF obligations, how to complete CDD forms, and when to escalate |
| **Store Manager** | Under the streamlined model, receives referrals of physical currency transactions and determines if regulated |
| **Wholesale Dealer / Trader** | Deals in precious metals/stones at higher volumes; needs full CDD and monitoring procedures |
| **Scrap Metal Dealer** | Buys/sells scrap jewellery; needs to understand they are higher risk and may require enhanced due diligence from sellers |
| **AML/CTF Compliance Officer** | Needs templates, checklists, record-keeping guidance, review triggers, escalation procedures, and reporting procedures |

> **Note:** Jewellers who **never** accept physical currency or virtual assets (Option 1) are NOT a target user — they have no AML/CTF obligations under these reforms.

---

## 5. Design Principles

| Principle | Detail |
|---|---|
| **No APIs, No Backend** | 100% static site. All data stays in localStorage. Zero network calls after page load. |
| **No Legal Risk** | Every page carries a disclaimer. Content sourced only from public AUSTRAC documents. Tool provides guidance, never "advice". |
| **Aligned to AUSTRAC Starter Kit** | Structure mirrors AUSTRAC's 3-step approach: Customise → Implement → Maintain & Review. |
| **Plain English** | Regulatory jargon is translated. Tooltips explain technical terms. |
| **Mobile-First** | Many jewellers work from shop counters. UI must be fully responsive. |
| **Progress Persistence** | Checklist progress, risk assessment results, and form data saved in browser localStorage. |
| **Print-Friendly** | Key sections (checklists, templates, red flags, forms) can be printed or exported as PDF via browser print. |
| **Offline-Capable** | Once loaded, the entire app works without internet. |

### 7.2 Am I Regulated? (Decision Tree + Regulation Options) — NEW PAGE

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Precious Metals, Stones and Products Services (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/before-you-start/new-industries-and-services-be-regulated-reform/precious-metals-stones-and-products-services-reform) | [Regulation Options for Dealers](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/regulation-options-dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products)

**Purpose:** Interactive decision tree that helps a user determine if they are captured by the reforms and which regulation option applies.

**How It Works:**
A step-by-step yes/no questionnaire:

```
Q1: Does your business buy or sell precious metals, precious stones, 
    or precious products (jewellery, watches, goldsmith/silversmith wares)?
  → YES → Go to Q2.
  → NO → You are likely NOT a dealer in precious metals/stones/products.

Q2: Do you accept physical currency (cash — banknotes and coins) or 
    virtual assets (e.g., cryptocurrency) as payment?
  → YES → Go to Q3.
  → NO → You are likely NOT regulated (Option 1). You have no AML/CTF 
          obligations for these services.

Q3: Do any single transactions, or linked/structured transactions, 
    reach $10,000 or more in physical currency or virtual assets?
  → YES → You are providing a designated service. Go to Q4.
  → NO → Go to Q3b.

Q3b: Could transactions be linked (e.g., lay-by, instalments, 
     same customer/same day)?
  → YES → If linked transactions reach $10,000+, you are providing 
           a designated service. Go to Q4.
  → NO → You may not be regulated (Option 2), but you should have 
          monitoring systems in place. See Regulation Options.

Q4: Do you deal only with individual customers (not companies, 
    trusts, or entities)?
  → YES → You may be eligible for the streamlined compliance 
           process (Option 3). See Regulation Options.
  → NO → You likely need a full AML/CTF program (Option 4). 
          Proceed to Obligations Overview.

Q5: Does the service have a geographical link to Australia?
  → YES → Confirmed — you are likely providing a designated service.
  → NO → The reforms may not apply. Seek professional advice.
```

**Output:**
- Clear result: "Based on your answers, you are likely [regulated (Option 3/4) / exempt (Option 1/2) / unsure]"
- If regulated: link to Obligations Overview and Enrolment Guide, with recommended regulation option
- If exempt: explanation of why, with caveat to confirm with AUSTRAC and implement monitoring for linked transactions
- If unsure: recommendation to seek professional advice

**UI Elements:**
- Card-based stepper with YES/NO buttons
- Regulation Options comparison table shown alongside
- Visual flow diagram
- Result saved to localStorage
- Print-friendly result summary

### 7.3 Obligations Overview

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Summary of AML/CTF Obligations for Tranche 2 Entities](https://www.austrac.gov.au/about-us/amlctf-reform/summary-amlctf-obligations-tranche-2-entities) | [Regulatory Expectations for Implementation](https://www.austrac.gov.au/austrac-regulatory-expectations-implementation-amlctf-reforms)

**Purpose:** Explain, in plain English, what the new law means for jewellers and precious goods dealers.

**Content Sections:**

#### What Changed?
- Brief explanation of the AML/CTF Act reform (Tranche 2)
- Why precious metals/stones/products were included (high ML risk, cash-based anonymity, ease of concealment, FATF recommendations)
- Link to AUSTRAC's reform overview page

#### Who Is Affected?
- The designated service (buying/selling for $10,000+ in cash/virtual assets) with examples
- Definition of "precious metals, stones and products" under the Act

#### Your Core Obligations (Summary Cards)

Each obligation is a clickable card that links to the relevant detailed section:

| # | Obligation | Links To |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Determine your regulation option | Section 7.2 |
| 2 | Enrol with AUSTRAC | Section 7.7 |
| 3 | Appoint a compliance officer | Section 7.6 |
| 4 | Conduct an ML/TF/PF risk assessment | Section 7.4 |

- **If you provide a regulated transaction without an AML/CTF program, you'll be in breach of many obligations and could face serious penalties**
- AUSTRAC has stated they will take a proportionate, risk-based approach to enforcement for newly regulated sectors

**UI Elements:**
- Accordion-style expandable sections
- "Jargon Buster" tooltips on technical terms (hover over "designated service", "physical currency", "virtual assets", "reporting entity", "ML/TF/PF" etc.)
- Visual icons for each obligation
- "AUSTRAC Says" callout boxes with direct quotes from official guidance

### 7.4 Risk Assessment Wizard

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Step 1: Customise Your Jeweller Program](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/step-1-customise-your-jeweller-program-using-starter-kit) | [Risk Insights for Dealers in Precious Stones, Metals and Other Products](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-guidance-and-resources/guidance-resources/risk-insights-and-indicators-suspicious-activity-dealers-precious-stones-metals-and-other-products)

**Purpose:** Guide the jeweller through a structured self-assessment of their money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing (ML/TF/PF) risk — aligned to AUSTRAC's starter kit risk assessment template.

**Important context:** AUSTRAC's 2024 National Risk Assessment rated the retail jewellery sector as **HIGH** for money laundering risk. Precious metals and stones are among the most at-risk goods because they can be bought anonymously, are easy to conceal and transport, difficult to trace, and easy to convert back to funds.

**How It Works:**
The wizard asks a series of multiple-choice questions across **four risk categories** (aligned to AUSTRAC's risk framework):

#### Category 1: Customer Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Do you deal with customers you've never met face-to-face? | Higher risk — identity verification harder |
| Do you deal with foreign buyers or sellers? | Higher risk — foreign jurisdiction risk |
| Do you transact with companies, trusts, or complex legal structures? | Higher risk — beneficial ownership opacity |
| Do you deal with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) or their associates? | Higher risk — corruption/bribery exposure. Foreign PEPs must always be treated as high risk. |
| Do you have customers whose source of wealth is unclear? | Higher risk — proceeds of crime |
| Do you deal with other jewellers as customers? | Higher risk — AUSTRAC identifies jewellers as higher risk customers |
| Do you deal with scrap metal dealers? | Higher risk — difficult to trace source of scrap jewellery |
| Do you deal with customers who are reluctant to provide identification? | Higher risk — identity concealment |
| Do you have customers who make high-volume purchases? | Higher risk — potential money laundering pattern |
| Do you deal with customers who don't appear to understand or have experience with precious goods? | Higher risk — may be buying to store value rather than for legitimate purpose |

#### Category 2: Service/Product Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Do you sell precious stones (especially loose diamonds)? | Higher risk — easily transportable, difficult to trace, retain value |
| Do you sell precious metals (gold, silver, platinum) in unmanufactured form? | Higher risk — easily melted, refined, or reshaped |
| Do you sell high-value watches? | Medium–High risk — commonly found in proceeds-of-crime |
| Do you buy/sell scrap jewellery or scrap precious metals? | Higher risk — source difficult to trace, could be stolen |
| Do you accept physical currency (cash) of $50,000 or more? | Higher risk — AUSTRAC automatic high-risk trigger |
| Do you accept virtual assets (cryptocurrency)? | Higher risk — anonymity concerns |
| Do you handle items that could be stolen, conflict, or counterfeit? | Higher risk — AUSTRAC specific high-risk factor |
| Do you handle transactions with no apparent economic or legal purpose? | Higher risk — potential ML/TF activity |
| Do you offer lay-by or instalment payments in cash? | Medium risk — potential for linked transactions to exceed threshold |

#### Category 3: Delivery Channel Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Are any of your transactions conducted entirely online or remotely? | Higher risk — non-face-to-face verification challenges |
| Do you use third-party agents, introducers, or intermediaries? | Higher risk — reliance on third parties for CDD |
| Do you outsource product delivery through couriers or postal services? | Medium risk — lengthens and complicates delivery chain |
| Do you accept orders via phone or messaging without in-person contact? | Higher risk — identity verification harder |

#### Category 4: Geographic / Foreign Jurisdiction Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Do you deal with buyers or sellers from countries identified as high-risk by FATF? | Higher risk — FATF grey/blacklist jurisdictions |
| Do funds for your transactions originate from overseas? | Higher risk — international fund flows |
| Do you source precious metals or stones from overseas (including scrap)? | Higher risk — difficult to trace origin, gemstone pipeline complexity |
| Do your customers have no apparent connection to the area where your business is located? | Medium risk — unusual geographic pattern |
| Do you deal with customers from countries with weak AML/CTF frameworks, high corruption, or known as tax havens? | Higher risk — regulatory arbitrage |

**Output:**
- **Visual risk matrix** — 4-quadrant chart (Low / Medium / High / Very High) per category
- **Overall risk rating** with colour coding
- **Tailored action items** based on rating
- **Recommended regulation option** (Option 1–4) based on risk profile
- **"AUSTRAC Says" callout** with relevant risk insights from the official guidance
- Ability to **save and print** the risk assessment result
- Saved results feed into the Program Builder (Section 7.5) to pre-populate relevant checklist items

**Disclaimer callout:** "This wizard helps you understand your risk profile for guidance purposes. It does not replace the formal ML/TF/PF risk assessment required under the AML/CTF Rules. Consider engaging a professional to complete your formal risk assessment."

### 7.5 AML/CTF Program Builder (Policy & Process Checklist)

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Step 1: Customise Your Jeweller Program](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/step-1-customise-your-jeweller-program-using-starter-kit)

**Purpose:** A comprehensive, tickable checklist of everything that should be in the AML/CTF program — structured to mirror AUSTRAC's starter kit documents.

**Aligned to AUSTRAC Starter Kit Structure:**
- The starter kit contains core documents: **Customise Guide**, **Risk Assessment**, **Policy Document**, **Process Document**
- Plus supporting forms for personnel and customers
- Once customised and approved by senior management, it becomes the official AML/CTF program
- **Important:** The starter kit is NOT designed to be used as-is. You must complete the customisation step to create a program that reflects your business.

**AUSTRAC Downloadable Templates:**

| Document | Download |
|---|---|
| Jeweller Process Document | [Word, 926 KB](https://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/2026-01/Jewellers%20-%20Process%20document%20-%20January%202026.docx) |

> Additional templates (Customise Guide, Risk Assessment, Policy Document) are available from the [Jeweller Program Starter Kit Document Library](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/program-starter-kits/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/jeweller-program-starter-kit-document-library).

**4-Step Customisation Process (from AUSTRAC Customise Guide):**
1. **Customise your risk assessment** — Identify relevant risks, their significance, and acceptable risk levels
2. **Customise personnel sections** — Assign AML/CTF roles, conduct personnel due diligence, plan training
3. **Tailor customer sections** — Establish CDD procedures, transaction detection systems, monitoring, and risk response processes

### 7.8 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) — EXPANDED

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Step 2: Use Your Jeweller Program](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/step-2-use-your-jeweller-program) | [Examples of Dealing with Customers](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/jeweller-program-starter-kit-examples-dealing-customers)

**Purpose:** Provide clear, step-by-step guidance on how to identify and verify customers for each entity type, including when to apply enhanced or ongoing due diligence.

**Overarching Principle:** You must conduct initial CDD **before providing a designated service** (i.e., before completing a purchase or sale of precious goods for $10,000+ in cash/virtual assets). If CDD cannot be completed satisfactorily, you should consider whether to decline or cease providing the service.

**Critical AUSTRAC warning:** If a customer approaches you for a regulated transaction and you hold a suspicion that must be reported, you must make a suspicious matter report. This is even if you **divert the customer to an alternative payment method** (e.g., bank transfer). Accepting payment through alternative means when you hold a suspicion **could make you complicit in criminal conduct**.

#### 7.8.0a Who Is Your Customer?

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Precious Metals, Stones and Products Services (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/before-you-start/new-industries-and-services-be-regulated-reform/precious-metals-stones-and-products-services-reform)

Your customer is the **buyer or the seller** (as the case may be) in the transaction. If you are selling precious goods, the buyer is your customer. If you are buying precious goods (e.g., buying scrap jewellery), the seller is your customer.

#### 7.8.0b Customer Risk Rating Table — FROM AUSTRAC STARTER KIT

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Step 2: Use Your Jeweller Program](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/step-2-use-your-jeweller-program)

AUSTRAC's starter kit defines three risk ratings with specific criteria and risk factors:

| Risk Rating | Criteria | Customer Risk Factors | Controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HIGH** | One or more high-risk factors, or you identify other reasons the customer is high risk | Precious metals/stones/products purchased with **$50,000+ in physical currency**; transactions involving particularly high-risk metals and stones; transactions involving **stolen, conflict or counterfeit** items; customers who are **scrap metal dealers**; customers whose requests are unusual or have no apparent economic/legal purpose; you suspect criminal activity (ML, TF, fraud, tax evasion, corruption, drug trafficking, people smuggling); **foreign PEPs**; complex or unusual legal structures creating anonymity; delivery channels making identity difficult to establish; unexplained wealth | Enhanced CDD; source of funds and source of wealth check; adverse media check; verify business relationship; senior manager approval |
| **MEDIUM** | Two or more medium-risk factors, or you identify other reasons the customer is medium risk | Domestic or international organisation PEPs; a third party not enrolled with AUSTRAC representing the customer; customer is a charity or non-profit organisation | Initial CDD (simplified CDD not appropriate) |
| **LOW** | Doesn't meet high or medium-risk criteria | Customer isn't medium or high risk | Simplified CDD |

**Important AUSTRAC note:** *"If you risk rate your customer and don't want to apply the controls above, you could instead ensure that they pay for precious metals, stones or products using a method other than physical currency, such as via bank transfer."*

#### 7.8.0c Customer Lifecycle (8-Step Process) — FROM AUSTRAC STARTER KIT

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Step 2: Use Your Jeweller Program](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/step-2-use-your-jeweller-program)

| Step | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify the kind of customer** | Determine if they're an individual or entity (trust, company, etc.) and the type of service sought. This determines which onboarding form applies. |
| 2 | **Collect customer information** | Use the relevant onboarding form. Level of information depends on customer type, service nature, and ML/TF risk factors. |
| 3 | **Verify customer information** | Follow the relevant initial CDD form to confirm collected information is reliable for AML/CTF purposes. |
| 4 | **Identify and assess triggers** | Watch for inconsistencies, unusual behaviour, higher-risk indicators. Can occur during onboarding or at any point during the relationship. |
| 5 | **Decide how to proceed** | Based on checks: proceed, apply additional controls, escalate/report, or decline service. |
| 6 | **Provide the designated service** | Generally only after required checks are complete and risks addressed. May delay CDD if criteria are met. |
| 7 | **Ongoing customer due diligence** | Monitor for changes in behaviour, respond to new triggers, update customer information during the relationship. |
| 8 | **End of business relationship** | Determine what records to keep, how long, and how they support future reviews. |

#### 7.8.1 Initial CDD — Individual Customers

**Streamlined CDD Process (Option 3):**
For low/medium risk individual customers paying in physical currency, AUSTRAC has developed a streamlined process:
1. Physical currency transaction is referred to store owner/manager
2. Manager determines if the transaction is regulated ($10,000+ in cash/virtual assets)
3. If regulated, manager follows the streamlined CDD form
4. Simplified verification and risk assessment for low/medium risk individuals

#### 7.8.7 Ongoing CDD — NEW PAGE

**Purpose:** Explain what ongoing customer due diligence means and when to apply it.

**What Is Ongoing CDD?**
After initial CDD, you must continue to monitor the customer relationship for its duration. This includes:

- Keeping customer information **up to date**
- Monitoring **transactions** for consistency with the customer's known profile
- Being alert to **changes in risk**
- **Re-verifying identity** if doubts arise
- Conducting **periodic reviews** of higher-risk customers more frequently

**Interactive Checklist — Ongoing CDD Review:**

- [ ] Customer information is current (name, address, contact)
- [ ] Transaction is consistent with customer's known profile
- [ ] No new red flags or suspicious indicators identified
- [ ] Source of funds remains consistent with expectations
- [ ] PEP/TFS status re-checked
- [ ] Risk rating reviewed and confirmed / updated
- [ ] Review date recorded

#### 7.8.8 PEP & Sanctions Screening — NEW PAGE

**Purpose:** Explain PEP and TFS screening obligations in plain English.

**What Is a PEP?**
A Politically Exposed Person is someone who holds or has held a prominent public position, domestically or internationally. This includes heads of state, government ministers, senior government officials, military leaders, judiciary members, senior executives of state-owned enterprises, and their **family members** and **close associates**.

**AUSTRAC requirement for jewellers: You must always treat foreign PEPs as high-risk customers.**

**What Is TFS?**
Targeted Financial Sanctions against specific individuals and entities. It is illegal to provide services to sanctioned persons.

**Screening Process:**
1. Ask the customer whether they are a PEP or associated with a PEP
2. Check the Australian Government's **Consolidated List** of sanctioned persons/entities
3. Document the screening result
4. If a PEP is identified → apply EDD (Section 7.8.6)
5. If a sanctioned person is identified → **do not proceed** and seek legal advice

**Resources Linked:**
- DFAT Consolidated List: [https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/consolidated-list](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/consolidated-list)

#### 7.8.9 Delayed CDD

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Delayed Initial Customer Due Diligence (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/customer-due-diligence-reform/initial-customer-due-diligence-reform/delayed-initial-customer-due-diligence-reform)

**When You May Delay CDD:**
You may delay initial CDD if **both** conditions are met:
1. Low additional ML/TF/PF risk if you delay
2. Delaying is essential to avoid interrupting the ordinary course of business

**Mandatory Completion Rules:**
- CDD must be completed **as soon as reasonably practicable**
- **Sanctions screening must still be completed without delay**
- **Civil penalties apply** if you fail to verify within required timeframes

#### 7.8.10 Third-Party Reliance Arrangements

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Reliance Under CDD Arrangements (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/about-us/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/customer-due-diligence-reform/reliance-customer-identification-third-party-reform/reliance-under-customer-due-diligence-arrangements-reform)

**AUSTRAC Risk Factor:** A third party that isn't enrolled with AUSTRAC representing the customer is a **medium risk factor**.

You may rely on CDD conducted by another reporting entity, but you **remain responsible** for ensuring CDD obligations are met.

#### 7.8.11 When CDD Cannot Be Completed

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [CDD Before Providing a Designated Service](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-guidance-and-resources/guidance-resources/amlctf-reforms-customer-due-diligence-providing-designated-service)

| Scenario | Recommended Action |
|---|---|
| Customer refuses to provide ID | Decline to proceed. Consider filing an SMR. |
| Customer provides inconsistent or fraudulent documents | Do not proceed. Escalate internally. File an SMR. |
| Beneficial owner cannot be identified | Do not proceed until identified. Apply EDD. |
| Customer is on the DFAT sanctions list | **Do not proceed under any circumstances.** |
| Customer's source of funds cannot be verified | Consider declining. If proceeding, apply EDD and document rationale. |

**AUSTRAC High-Risk Worked Example:** In AUSTRAC's jeweller example, the compliance officer finds the customer's low income doesn't support a $50,000 cash purchase, and the customer cannot provide dividend statements to substantiate their wealth. The compliance officer submits an SMR, and the senior manager **rejects the transaction** as it falls outside the business's risk appetite. The customer is told the refusal is because the cash amount exceeds accepted limits.

#### 7.8.12 Privacy Obligations & CDD Data

**Key Points:**
- CDD collection is under legal obligation (AML/CTF Act) — permitted under APPs
- Only collect information reasonably necessary for CDD
- Store securely, do not use for marketing
- Customers can be told collection is required under AML/CTF law
- SMR records require additional care (tipping-off prohibition)

### 7.9 Suspicious Activity & Red Flags — EXPANDED

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Risk Insights and Indicators of Suspicious Activity for Dealers in Precious Stones, Metals and Other Products](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-guidance-and-resources/guidance-resources/risk-insights-and-indicators-suspicious-activity-dealers-precious-stones-metals-and-other-products)

**Purpose:** Help jewellers and precious goods dealers recognise warning signs of money laundering — **aligned to AUSTRAC's risk categories** from their official guidance.

**Context:** AUSTRAC states that dealers in precious stones and metals are **among the most at risk of being used for money laundering in Australia**. Authorities often find criminals with jewellery and luxury watches containing precious stones and metals, especially diamonds.

**Why precious goods are vulnerable to ML:**
- Can be bought and sold readily and **anonymously** using cash or virtual assets
- Can be bought and sold **without proving ownership**
- Used to buy illicit goods and services anonymously
- **Easy to conceal and move** domestically or offshore
- **Difficult to trace or detect**
- Easy to **reshape, alter, remodel, melt, refine or hide** in common objects
- Easy to **convert back to legitimate funds**

**"What Should I Do?" Action Guidance:**

```
1. STOP — Do not tip off the customer about your concerns.
2. DOCUMENT — Record your observations and concerns in writing.
3. ESCALATE — Report your concerns to your AML/CTF compliance officer.
4. ASSESS — The compliance officer assesses whether an SMR should be filed.
5. REPORT — If grounds exist, file an SMR with AUSTRAC within the 
   required timeframe.
6. DO NOT DIVERT — If you suspect criminal activity, do NOT simply 
   redirect the customer to pay by bank transfer. This could make 
   you complicit.
7. CONTINUE MONITORING — Even if no SMR is filed, continue monitoring.

### 7.10 Reporting to AUSTRAC — EXPANDED

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Suspicious Matter Reports (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/reporting-austrac-reform/suspicious-matter-reports-reform) | [Threshold Transaction Reports (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/reporting-austrac-reform/threshold-transaction-reports-reform) | [Reporting to AUSTRAC (Reform)](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/reporting-austrac-reform)

**Purpose:** Explain the types of reports, when to file them, how to file them, and the tipping-off prohibition.

#### 7.10.1 Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs)

**When You Must File:**
An SMR must be submitted if you suspect, on **reasonable grounds**, that:
- A person is committing or planning money laundering or terrorism financing
- A customer is not who they claim to be
- You have information relevant to the investigation of an offence

**Key SMR Rules:**
- Submit a **separate SMR each time** you form a new suspicion
- SMR obligations apply even if you **decide not to provide** the service
- You do NOT need to be certain — **suspicion** on reasonable grounds is sufficient
- **Even if you divert the customer to a non-cash payment method, you must still file an SMR if you hold a suspicion**

**Timeframes:**

| Scenario | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Suspicion relates to **terrorism financing** | Within **24 hours** |
| All other suspicions | Within **3 business days** |

**How to File:** Via [AUSTRAC Online](https://online.austrac.gov.au)

**Jeweller Example (from AUSTRAC):**
> A customer wants to buy $50,000 worth of loose diamonds in cash. Their low income doesn't support the purchase, and they can't provide evidence of dividend income. The compliance officer files an SMR. The senior manager rejects the transaction as it falls outside the business's risk appetite, telling the customer the cash amount exceeds accepted limits.

#### 7.10.2 Threshold Transaction Reports (TTRs)

**When You Must File:**
A TTR is required when you receive **$10,000 or more in physical currency** in a single transaction.

**Physical currency** = banknotes and coins. It does NOT include electronic transfers, cheques, credit/debit card payments, or cryptocurrency.

**Timeframe:** Within **10 business days** after the transaction.

**How to File:** Via [AUSTRAC Online](https://online.austrac.gov.au)

**Structuring Warning:**
If a customer appears to be **breaking up cash payments** to stay under $10,000, this is **structuring** — a criminal offence. This should also trigger an SMR.

#### 7.10.3 Annual Compliance Reports

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Step 2: Use Your Jeweller Program](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/step-2-use-your-jeweller-program)

An annual compliance report submitted to AUSTRAC about how you met your obligations during the previous calendar year.

#### 7.10.4 Tipping-Off Prohibition

**Critical Legal Requirement:**

You **MUST NOT** disclose ("tip off") to the customer or any other person that:
- You have filed or intend to file an SMR
- You suspect or have formed a suspicion about the customer
- AUSTRAC is investigating or may investigate the customer

**Penalties for tipping off are severe** — this is a criminal offence.

**What You CAN Do:**
- Discuss your concerns with your compliance officer
- Seek legal advice
- Continue to provide the service normally (unless declining)
- File the SMR
- Tell the customer the refusal is because the transaction value exceeds accepted limits (as in AUSTRAC's example)

**What You CANNOT Do:**
- Tell the customer you've reported them
- Warn the customer that their transaction looks suspicious
- Discuss SMR details with colleagues who don't need to know

**UI Elements:**
- Interactive internal escalation flowchart
- Decision tree: "Should I file an SMR?"
- TTR calculator: enter cash amount → tells you if TTR is required
- Transaction detection calculator: enter linked transaction amounts → tells you if threshold reached
- Tipping-off prohibition highlighted in a red warning box

**Purpose:** Clear guidance on what to keep, how to keep it, and for how long.

**Records to Retain:**

| Record Type | Examples |

   - a) Yes — all jewellers are regulated
   - b) No — if you don't accept physical currency or virtual assets, you are not providing a designated service

    - b) Yes — buying to store value rather than for genuine interest is a recognised ML indicator
    - **Answer: b**

### 7.17 Real-World Customer Examples (Low / Medium / High Risk) — NEW PAGE

> **📎 AUSTRAC Source:** [Jeweller Program Starter Kit: Examples of Dealing with Customers](https://www.austrac.gov.au/reforms/sector-specific-guidance/dealers-precious-metals-stones-and-products-guidance/jeweller-program-starter-kit/jeweller-program-starter-kit-examples-dealing-customers)

#### Example 1: Low-Risk Customer

**Scenario:** A jeweller accepts a request to create a custom diamond ring valued at **$12,000**. Customer asks to pay in cash.

**Key Points:**
- Customer provides reason: engagement ring
- Completes onboarding form, provides driver's licence
- No medium or high-risk factors identified → rated **LOW risk**
- Simplified CDD: identity verification, sanctions check, PEP check
- Uses escalation checklist — no triggers present
- Transaction completed, business relationship concludes — no further ongoing CDD required
- **Compliance boils down to ~3 forms** for this typical customer

#### Example 2: Medium-Risk Customer

**Scenario:** Individual wants to purchase a custom bracelet and watch valued at **$15,000** with cash. Both contain precious stones. Individual is acting as representative for their employer (a sole trader).

**Key Points:**
- **Medium risk factors:** Employer is a domestic PEP (parent of a state MP) + representative is a third-party agent not enrolled with AUSTRAC
- Representative completes onboarding form on behalf of employer (customer)
- Identity verified for both representative AND customer (employer)
- PEP check: customer is family member of domestic PEP; representative is not a PEP
- Sanctions check completed — no matches
- Escalation triggers reviewed — no escalation needed
- Final rating remains **MEDIUM**
- Transaction completed, relationship concludes — no further ongoing CDD

#### Example 3: High-Risk Customer

**Scenario:** Individual wants to purchase **100-point loose diamonds** using **$50,000 in cash**.

**Key Points:**
- **High risk factors:** Cash transaction $50,000+ ; purchasing easily transportable high-value items (loose diamonds that retain value and don't need labour to improve)
- Must **escalate to AML/CTF compliance officer**
- Compliance officer conducts enhanced CDD:
  - Identity verification
  - **Source of funds check:** Customer claims dividends from shares
  - **Source of wealth check:** Customer claims salary and dividends
  - Customer's **low income doesn't support the purchase**
  - Customer **cannot provide dividend statements** — makes excuses
  - **Adverse media check** — no adverse results found
- Compliance officer forms **reasonable grounds for suspicion** → submits **SMR to AUSTRAC**
- Senior manager **rejects the transaction** — falls outside business risk appetite
- Customer told refusal is because cash amount exceeds accepted limits
- Customer advised they can deposit funds into a bank account and pay via bank transfer or EFTPOS

**UI Elements:**
- Three tabbed panels (Low / Medium / High risk)
- Step-by-step timeline with visual indicators
- Key decision points highlighted

### 7.19 FAQ — EXPANDED

| # | Question | Short Answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | I'm a jeweller who only accepts credit cards and bank transfers. Am I regulated? | No. If you never accept physical currency or virtual assets, you are not providing a designated service (Option 1). |
| 2 | I sometimes accept small cash payments under $10,000. Am I regulated? | Potentially. You must monitor for linked or structured transactions that cumulatively reach $10,000+. If they do, you need an AML/CTF program. |
| 3 | What if a customer pays $5,000 in cash today and $5,000 in cash next week for the same purchase? | These are likely linked transactions. Once they exceed $10,000 cumulatively, you are providing a designated service and must complete CDD. |
| 4 | Can I avoid regulation by telling customers to pay by bank transfer? | Yes, for legitimate customers. But if you already suspect criminal activity, redirecting to bank transfer does NOT remove your SMR obligation and could make you complicit. |
| 5 | Do watches count as precious products? | Yes, if they contain precious metals or stones. A stainless-steel watch with diamonds set on the face is a precious product. |
| 6 | Is a gold-plated item a precious product? | Only if it contains precious metals or stones at or above the defined thresholds (2%+ alloy weight). |
| 7 | What about costume jewellery? | Costume jewellery that contains NO precious metals or stones is NOT a precious product and is NOT regulated. |
| 8 | I'm a bullion dealer. Does this guidance apply to me? | No. Bullion dealing is a separate designated service with its own requirements. |
| 9 | What if I suspect money laundering but I'm not sure? | You don't need to be certain. If you have suspicion on reasonable grounds, file an SMR. |
| 10 | What are the penalties for non-compliance? | Non-compliance carries significant penalties. AUSTRAC will focus enforcement on entities that fail to enrol or make no meaningful effort. |
| 11 | How much does it cost to enrol with AUSTRAC? | Enrolment with AUSTRAC is free. |
| 12 | A customer wants to buy $50,000 worth of loose diamonds with cash. What's my risk rating for this customer? | Automatic **HIGH risk** — $50,000+ in physical currency is a high-risk factor. Escalate to compliance officer. |
| 13 | Are scrap metal dealers always high risk? | AUSTRAC identifies scrap metal dealers as a high-risk customer type because it's difficult to trace the origin of scrap jewellery. |
| 14 | Do I need to screen every cash customer for sanctions? | Yes — PEP and TFS screening is part of initial CDD for every customer in a regulated transaction. |
| 15 | Can I outsource my AML/CTF program? | You can use external consultants and appoint an external compliance officer, but you remain ultimately responsible. |

## 10. Content Sourcing Rules

1. **Only use publicly available AUSTRAC publications** — starter kits, fact sheets, guidance, the AML/CTF Act, and the AML/CTF Rules 2025
2. **Never paraphrase the law** in a way that could be interpreted as legal advice
3. **Always use hedging language** — "you may need to", "consider whether", "AUSTRAC guidance suggests"
4. **Never say "you must" as our own assertion** — instead say "AUSTRAC requires reporting entities to..."
5. **Cite sources** — link to the original AUSTRAC page wherever possible
6. **Never collect or process real customer data** — template forms for guidance only
7. **Clearly distinguish the tool from AUSTRAC's starter kit** — complements, not replaces
8. **Include "last reviewed" dates** on all content sections
9. **Recommend professional advice** wherever the user is making a judgment call

## 11. Success Metrics (POC)

| Metric | How to Assess |
|---|---|
| **Completeness** | Does the tool cover all core obligations identified by AUSTRAC? |
| **Alignment** | Does the structure match AUSTRAC's Customise → Implement → Maintain approach? |
| **Accuracy** | Does all content align with current AUSTRAC guidance (as of Feb 2026)? |
| **Clarity** | Can a non-expert jeweller complete the risk assessment and CDD forms without external help? |
| **Usability** | Is the UI intuitive on both desktop and mobile? |
| **Form Coverage** | Are all 25 template forms functional and printable? |
| **Quiz Quality** | Do the 15 quiz questions accurately test understanding of key obligations? |
| **Safety** | Does the disclaimer adequately protect the creator from legal liability? |
| **Regulation Options** | Does the tool clearly guide jewellers to the appropriate regulation option? |

## 12. Future Enhancements (Post-POC)

| Enhancement | Complexity | Value |
|---|---|---|
| PDF export of completed AML/CTF program | Medium | High |
| Multi-location support (separate localStorage namespaces) | Low | Medium |
| FATF list auto-update (periodic JSON fetch) | Low | Medium |
| Transaction detection calculator (linked transactions) | Low | High |
| Integration with AUSTRAC Online | High (needs API) | High |
| AI-powered Q&A chatbot | High (needs API) | High |
| Sector expansion (shared platform with real estate, accountants) | Medium | High |
| Digital ID verification integration | High (needs API) | High |
| Inventory tracking integration (which items are precious products) | Medium | Medium |
| Virtual assets monitoring tools | High | Medium |

---

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Content interpreted as legal advice | Legal liability for creator | Strong disclaimers; hedging language; cite AUSTRAC sources; recommend professional advice |
| AUSTRAC guidance changes after launch | Outdated content | Version-stamp all content; link to sources; monitor AUSTRAC updates |
| Users rely solely on this tool | Non-compliance if incomplete/outdated | Repeatedly state tool complements starter kit; recommend professional advice |
| Jeweller incorrectly self-assesses regulation option | Non-compliance if they choose wrong option | Clear decision tree; prominent warnings about linked transaction risk; recommend professional advice |
| localStorage cleared accidentally | Lost progress | "Export All Data" as JSON; encourage backups; display warning |
| Accessibility issues | Exclusion of users with disabilities | Follow WCAG 2.1 AA; test with screen readers; ensure keyboard navigation |
| Tool confused with official AUSTRAC product | Misleading users | Clear branding as independent tool; explicit statement not an AUSTRAC product |
| Payment diversion misconception | Jewellers may think redirecting suspicious customers to bank transfer absolves them | Prominent warning about complicity risk; training module dedicated to this |
