# AMLiq — AML/CTF Compliance Guide for Real Estate Agents

## Product Concept Document — v2.0

---

## 1. Vision

**AMLiq** is a lightweight, static, single-page web application that guides Australian real estate professionals through their new Anti-Money Laundering / Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) obligations under the reformed AML/CTF Act (Tranche 2), effective **1 July 2026**.

It is **not** legal advice. It is a practical, step-by-step guidance tool built entirely from publicly available AUSTRAC materials, including the official **Real Estate Program Starter Kit** released 30 January 2026.

The tool mirrors the structure of AUSTRAC's own starter kit — **Customise → Implement → Maintain & Review** — but wraps it in an interactive, user-friendly interface with checklists, wizards, template forms, and plain-English explanations.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

From **1 July 2026**, real estate businesses providing designated services will be required to:

- Enrol with AUSTRAC as a reporting entity (within 28 days of providing a designated service — by **29 July 2026**)
- Develop and maintain an AML/CTF program (risk assessment, policies, processes)
- Appoint an AML/CTF compliance officer
- Conduct initial and ongoing customer due diligence (CDD)
- Screen for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS)
- Report suspicious matters (SMRs), threshold transactions (TTRs), and international fund transfer instructions (IFTIs) to AUSTRAC
- Conduct personnel due diligence on staff in AML/CTF roles
- Keep records for 7 years
- Train staff on ML/TF/PF risks and obligations
- Conduct internal reviews and independent evaluations (at least every 3 years)

Most small to mid-sized real estate agencies have **zero experience** with AML/CTF compliance. AUSTRAC's 2024 National Risk Assessment rated real estate as a **high money laundering risk** sector. Real estate is one of the most common property types found in proceeds-of-crime investigations.

**AMLiq bridges that gap** by translating AUSTRAC's requirements into plain-English, actionable guidance with interactive tools — all for free, with no data leaving the user's browser.

---

## 3. Who Is Regulated (and Who Is Not)

### 3.1 Two Designated Services

The reforms capture **two categories** of real estate designated services:

| Designated Service | Who Typically Provides It |
|---|---|
| **Brokering real estate transactions** — acting on behalf of a buyer or seller in the sale, purchase, or transfer of real estate | Real estate agents, buyer's agents, seller's agents, auctioneers acting as selling agents |
| **Direct property sales** — selling real estate directly to a customer without an independent real estate agent | Property developers, businesses selling house-and-land packages, apartments off-the-plan, land subdivisions, businesses with in-house sales teams |

### 3.2 What Counts as "Real Estate"

Under the reform, real estate includes:

- **Fee simple interests** (standard freehold ownership)
- **Leasehold interests exceeding 30 years**
- **Unit trusts or share schemes** that confer entitlements to use or occupy land

The service must have a **geographical link to Australia** to trigger obligations.

### 3.3 What Is Exempt

| Service | Status |
|---|---|
| Property management (residential rentals) | **Exempt** — not a designated service |
| Commercial leasing | **Exempt** — not a designated service |
| Conveyancing | Regulated separately under conveyancer designated services |
| Legal work in property transactions | Regulated separately under legal profession designated services |

---

## 4. Target Users

| User Persona | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agency Principal / Owner** | Needs to understand overall obligations, set up the AML/CTF program, appoint a compliance officer, and get senior management sign-off |
| **Property Sales Agent** | Needs to know what CDD steps to follow per transaction, how to spot red flags, and when to escalate |
| **Buyer's Agent** | Same obligations as sales agents; needs CDD guidance tailored to representing purchasers |
| **Property Developer (Direct Sales)** | Needs to understand they are captured even without using an external agent |
| **AML/CTF Compliance Officer** | Needs templates, checklists, record-keeping guidance, review triggers, and reporting procedures |

> **Note:** Property managers are NOT a target user — property management is exempt from these obligations.

---

## 5. Design Principles

| Principle | Detail |
|---|---|
| **No APIs, No Backend** | 100% static site. All data stays in localStorage. Zero network calls after page load. |
| **No Legal Risk** | Every page carries a disclaimer. Content sourced only from public AUSTRAC documents. Tool provides guidance, never "advice". |
| **Aligned to AUSTRAC Starter Kit** | Structure mirrors AUSTRAC's 3-step approach: Customise → Implement → Maintain & Review. |
| **Plain English** | Regulatory jargon is translated. Tooltips explain technical terms. |
| **Mobile-First** | Many agents work from their phones on-site. UI must be fully responsive. |
| **Progress Persistence** | Checklist progress, risk assessment results, and form data saved in browser localStorage. |
| **Print-Friendly** | Key sections (checklists, templates, red flags, forms) can be printed or exported as PDF via browser print. |
| **Offline-Capable** | Once loaded, the entire app works without internet. |

### 7.2 Am I Regulated? (Decision Tree) — NEW PAGE

**Purpose:** Interactive decision tree that helps a user determine if they are captured by the reforms.

**How It Works:**
A step-by-step yes/no questionnaire:

```
Q1: Do you sell, buy, or transfer real estate on behalf of clients?
  → YES → You are likely providing a designated service (brokering). Go to Q4.
  → NO → Go to Q2.

Q2: Do you sell real estate directly to customers (e.g., as a developer)?
  → YES → You are likely providing a designated service (direct sales). Go to Q4.
  → NO → Go to Q3.

Q3: Do you only manage rental properties or commercial leases?
  → YES → You are likely EXEMPT. Property management and commercial 
           leasing are not designated services under the current reforms.
  → NO → Go to Q3b.

Q3b: Do you provide conveyancing or legal services in property transactions?
  → YES → You may be regulated under a different designated service 
           category. Check AUSTRAC's conveyancer or legal profession guidance.
  → NO → Based on your answers, you may not be captured. 
          Review AUSTRAC's full list of designated services to confirm.

Q4: Does the real estate have a geographical link to Australia?
  → YES → You are likely a reporting entity. Proceed to the Obligations Overview.
  → NO → The reforms may not apply. Seek professional advice.

Q5: Is the property interest one of: fee simple, leasehold >30 years, 
    or unit trust/share scheme conferring land use rights?
  → YES → Confirmed — you are likely providing a designated service.
  → NO → The interest may not be "real estate" under the Act. Seek advice.
```

**Output:**
- Clear result: "Based on your answers, you are likely [regulated / exempt / unsure]"
- If regulated: link to Obligations Overview and Enrolment Guide
- If exempt: explanation of why, with caveat to confirm with AUSTRAC
- If unsure: recommendation to seek professional advice

**UI Elements:**
- Card-based stepper with YES/NO buttons
- Visual flow diagram shown alongside
- Result saved to localStorage
- Print-friendly result summary

### 7.4 Risk Assessment Wizard

**Purpose:** Guide the agent through a structured self-assessment of their money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing (ML/TF/PF) risk — aligned to AUSTRAC's starter kit risk assessment template.

**Important context:** AUSTRAC's 2024 National Risk Assessment rated the real estate sector as **HIGH** for money laundering risk. Real estate is one of the most common property types in proceeds-of-crime investigations. This wizard helps agents understand *their specific* risk profile within that high-risk sector.

**How It Works:**
The wizard asks a series of multiple-choice questions across **four risk categories** (aligned to AUSTRAC's risk framework):

#### Category 1: Customer Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Do you deal with customers you've never met face-to-face? | Higher risk — identity verification harder |
| Do you deal with foreign buyers or sellers? | Higher risk — foreign jurisdiction risk |
| Do you transact with trusts, companies, or complex legal structures? | Higher risk — beneficial ownership opacity |
| Do you deal with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) or their associates? | Higher risk — corruption/bribery exposure |
| Do you have customers where the source of wealth is unclear? | Higher risk — proceeds of crime |
| Do you deal with customers who are reluctant to provide identification? | Higher risk — identity concealment |
| Do you deal with professional investors or high-net-worth individuals? | Medium risk — larger transaction values |
| Do you have many one-off or short-term customer relationships? | Higher risk — less opportunity for ongoing monitoring |

#### Category 2: Service/Product Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Do you handle residential property sales? | Standard risk (but most common ML vehicle) |
| Do you handle commercial or industrial property? | Medium risk — higher values, complex structures |
| Do you handle off-the-plan sales? | Higher risk — time gap between contract and settlement |
| Do you sell house-and-land packages? | Medium–High risk (developer direct sales) |
| Do you handle agricultural land or rural property? | Variable risk — depends on jurisdiction |
| Do you handle property valued above $5 million? | Higher risk — large single transactions attractive for ML |
| Do you handle auction sales? | Medium risk — compressed due diligence timeframes |

#### Category 3: Delivery Channel Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Are any of your transactions conducted entirely online or remotely? | Higher risk — non-face-to-face verification challenges |
| Do you use third-party agents, introducers, or referral partners? | Higher risk — reliance on third parties for CDD |
| Do customers interact through intermediaries (e.g., lawyers, accountants) rather than directly? | Medium risk — layered relationships |
| Do you accept instructions via email or messaging without in-person contact? | Higher risk — identity verification harder |

#### Category 4: Geographic / Foreign Jurisdiction Risk

| Question | Risk Implication |
|---|---|
| Do you deal with buyers or sellers from countries identified as high-risk by FATF? | Higher risk — FATF grey/blacklist jurisdictions |
| Do funds for your transactions originate from overseas? | Higher risk — international fund flows |
| Do you operate in areas known for drug production, organised crime, or gang activity? | Higher risk — local crime nexus |
| Do your customers have no apparent connection to the area where the property is located? | Medium risk — unusual geographic pattern |
| Do you deal with customers from countries with weak AML/CTF frameworks? | Higher risk — regulatory arbitrage |

**Output:**
- **Visual risk matrix** — 4-quadrant chart (Low / Medium / High / Very High) per category
- **Overall risk rating** with colour coding
- **Tailored action items** based on rating, e.g.:
  - "You deal with foreign buyers → Apply enhanced due diligence for customers from high-risk jurisdictions"
  - "You handle trusts → Ensure you identify all beneficial owners including settlors, appointors, and protectors"
  - "You operate fully online → Implement additional identity verification controls for non-face-to-face customers"
- **"AUSTRAC Says" callout** with relevant risk insights from the official guidance
- Ability to **save and print** the risk assessment result
- Saved results feed into the Program Builder (Section 7.5) to pre-populate relevant checklist items

**Disclaimer callout:** "This wizard helps you understand your risk profile for guidance purposes. It does not replace the formal ML/TF/PF risk assessment required under the AML/CTF Rules. Consider engaging a professional to complete your formal risk assessment."

### 7.8 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) — EXPANDED

**Purpose:** Provide clear, step-by-step guidance on how to identify and verify customers for each entity type, including when to apply enhanced or ongoing due diligence.

**Overarching Principle:** You must conduct initial CDD **before providing a designated service** (i.e., before acting for the customer in a property transaction). If CDD cannot be completed satisfactorily, you should consider whether to decline or cease providing the service.

#### 7.8.1 Initial CDD — Individual Customers

**What You Must Establish (on reasonable grounds):**
- The customer's identity
- The identity of any person acting on the customer's behalf and their authority to act
- The identity of any person on whose behalf the customer is receiving the service (e.g., a trust beneficiary instructing through an individual)
- Whether the customer is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) or designated for Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS)
- The nature and purpose of the business relationship or transaction

**Identification Information to Collect:**
- Full legal name
- Date of birth
- Residential address (not a PO Box)

**Verification — Acceptable Documents:**

| Category | Acceptable Documents |
|---|---|
| **Primary photographic ID** | Australian passport, Australian driver's licence, Australian proof-of-age card |
| **Primary non-photographic ID** | Australian birth certificate, Australian citizenship certificate |
| **Secondary ID** | Medicare card, pensioner concession card, utilities bill (within 3 months), bank statement, government-issued letter |

**Verification rules:**
- Original documents or reliable copies
- At least ONE primary document required
- If primary photographic ID is not available, use one primary non-photographic + one secondary
- Expired documents may require additional verification
- Record the document type, number, issuer, and expiry date

**Interactive Form — Individual CDD:**

| Field | Input |
|---|---|
| Customer full name | Text |
| Date of birth | Date |
| Residential address | Text |
| Acting on own behalf? | Yes / No (if No → identify the principal) |
| ID Document 1 — Type | Dropdown |
| ID Document 1 — Number | Text |
| ID Document 1 — Issuer | Text |
| ID Document 1 — Expiry | Date |
| ID Document 2 — Type (if required) | Dropdown |
| ID Document 2 — Number | Text |
| PEP screening completed? | Yes / No + date |
| TFS screening completed? | Yes / No + date |
| Source of funds discussed? | Yes / No |
| Nature/purpose of transaction | Text |
| Risk rating | Low / Medium / High |
| EDD required? | Yes / No (auto-flagged if High risk) |
| CDD completed by | Text |
| Date completed | Date |

#### 7.8.2 Initial CDD — Company Customers

**What You Must Establish:**

### 7.9 Suspicious Activity & Red Flags — EXPANDED

**Purpose:** Help agents recognise warning signs of money laundering in real estate transactions — **aligned to AUSTRAC's 4 risk categories** from their official "Risk insights and indicators of suspicious activity for the real estate sector" guidance.

**Context:** AUSTRAC states that real estate professionals are often the **first contact point** for criminals attempting to launder money through property. Being able to recognise red flags is critical.

#### Category 1: Customer Risk Indicators

| Red Flag | Detail |
|---|---|
| Customer reluctant to provide ID | Avoids, delays, or provides inconsistent identity documents |
| Customer uses different names | Name on contract differs from name on ID or bank account |
| Customer uses nominees or shell companies | Attempts to conceal the true buyer/owner |
| Customer is evasive about source of funds | Cannot or will not explain where purchase funds originate |
| Customer is unconcerned about price | Willingly overpays or shows no interest in negotiating |
| Customer has no apparent connection to property location | Buyer has no reason to invest in the area (no work, family, or business ties) |
| Customer is a PEP or associate of a PEP | Prominent public officials or their close associates |
| Customer's wealth is inconsistent with known profile | e.g., low-income individual purchasing a high-value property |
| Customer pressures for rapid completion | Pushes to settle unusually quickly without apparent reason |
| Complex ownership structures | Multiple layers of companies, trusts, or partnerships with no clear commercial rationale |

#### Category 2: Service/Transaction Risk Indicators

| Red Flag | Detail |
|---|---|
| Cash payments for large amounts | Buyer wants to pay all or part of the purchase price in physical cash |
| Funds from unrelated third parties | Purchase funded by someone with no clear connection to the buyer |
| Significantly above/below market value | Property purchased at a price that doesn't match market conditions |
| Quick buy-and-sell | Property bought and resold rapidly with no renovations or clear profit motive |
| Back-to-back transactions | Multiple transactions on the same property in a short period |
| Deposit paid from overseas with no explanation | International funds with no clear source or reason |
| Unusual contract terms | Side agreements, undisclosed rebates, or unusual settlement conditions |
| Transaction restructured to avoid thresholds | Breaking a cash payment into amounts just under $10,000 (structuring) |

#### Category 3: Delivery Channel Risk Indicators

| Red Flag | Detail |
|---|---|
| Entirely non-face-to-face transaction | Customer never meets the agent in person; all conducted remotely |
| Customer insists on communicating only via encrypted messaging | Avoids phone calls, emails, or traceable communication |
| Third-party intermediary provides all instructions | Customer is shielded behind lawyers, agents, or other intermediaries |
| Instructions change frequently or inconsistently | Shifting requirements that don't align with normal transaction patterns |

#### Category 4: Foreign Jurisdiction Risk Indicators

| Red Flag | Detail |
|---|---|
| Funds from high-risk jurisdictions | Money originates from FATF grey-listed or blacklisted countries |
| Customer based in a jurisdiction with weak AML controls | Countries known for poor AML/CTF frameworks |
| Multiple international transfers involved | Complex fund routing through several countries before reaching Australia |
| Customer has no connection to Australia | No residency, business, or family ties to Australia |
| Foreign corporate structures used to purchase | Offshore companies or trusts used to hold Australian property |

**"What Should I Do?" Action Guidance (shown on every card):**

```
1. STOP — Do not tip off the customer about your concerns.
2. DOCUMENT — Record your observations and concerns in writing.
3. ESCALATE — Report your concerns to your AML/CTF compliance officer 
   or the designated escalation point within your agency.
4. ASSESS — The compliance officer assesses whether an SMR should be filed.
5. REPORT — If grounds exist, file an SMR with AUSTRAC within the 
   required timeframe.
6. CONTINUE MONITORING — Even if no SMR is filed, continue monitoring 
   the relationship.
```

**UI Elements:**
- Filterable card grid organised by the 4 AUSTRAC risk categories
- Search bar to filter cards by keyword
- Each card is expandable for more detail and real-world scenario examples
- Colour-coded severity: amber (be alert), red (escalate immediately)

### 7.10 Reporting to AUSTRAC — EXPANDED

**Purpose:** Explain the three types of reports, when to file them, how to file them, and the tipping-off prohibition.

#### 7.10.1 Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs)

**When You Must File:**
An SMR must be submitted to AUSTRAC if you suspect, on **reasonable grounds**, that:
- A person is committing or planning money laundering or terrorism financing using a designated service
- A customer (or future customer or their agent) is not who they claim to be
- You have information that may be relevant to the investigation of an offence (including tax evasion, fraud, drug trafficking, terrorism financing, or money laundering)

**"Reasonable grounds"** = an objective standard. Would a reasonable person with similar knowledge and experience reach the same suspicion based on the available facts?

**Key SMR Rules:**
- You must submit a **separate SMR each time** you form a new suspicion about a customer
- If you've filed previous SMRs about the same person, reference those in the new report
- SMR obligations apply even if you **decide not to provide** the service
- You do NOT need to be certain — **suspicion** on reasonable grounds is sufficient

**Timeframes:**

| Scenario | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Suspicion relates to **terrorism financing** | Within **24 hours** |
| All other suspicions | Within **3 business days** |

**How to File:** Via [AUSTRAC Online](https://online.austrac.gov.au)

**What to Include:**
- Customer details (as known)
- Description of the suspicious activity
- Your grounds for suspicion
- Relevant transaction details
- Any supporting documents
- References to previous SMRs on the same person (if any)

**Real Estate Example:**
> A buyer insists on paying a $200,000 deposit in physical cash. They are evasive when asked about the source of funds and provide ID with a different address than on the contract. The agent should escalate internally, and the compliance officer should file an SMR.

#### 7.10.2 Threshold Transaction Reports (TTRs)

**When You Must File:**
A TTR is required when you receive **$10,000 or more in physical currency** (Australian or foreign equivalent) in a single transaction.

**Physical currency** = banknotes and coins. It does NOT include:
- Electronic bank transfers
- Cheques
- Credit/debit card payments
- Cryptocurrency

**Timeframe:** Within **10 business days** after the transaction.

**How to File:** Via [AUSTRAC Online](https://online.austrac.gov.au)

**What to Include:**
- Customer information
- Parties involved
- Designated services provided
- Transaction amount and date
- Purpose (if known)
- Account details (if applicable)

**Real Estate Example:**
> A customer pays a real estate agent $21,250 in cash as a deposit on a property. The agent must file a TTR within 10 business days. If the remaining settlement amount is paid by electronic transfer, no additional TTR is required for that payment.

**Structuring Warning:**
If a customer appears to be **breaking up cash payments** into amounts just under $10,000 to avoid the TTR threshold, this is called **structuring** and is itself a criminal offence. This should also trigger an SMR.

#### 7.10.3 International Fund Transfer Instructions (IFTIs)

**When You Must File:**
An IFTI report is required when you are involved in sending or receiving international electronic fund transfers.

**Timeframe:** Within **10 business days**

> Note: In most real estate transactions, the real estate agent is not directly involved in the fund transfer — the bank handles this. However, if you are directly involved in receiving or arranging international transfers, you have IFTI reporting obligations.

#### 7.10.4 Tipping-Off Prohibition

**Critical Legal Requirement:**

You **MUST NOT** disclose ("tip off") to the customer or any other person that:
- You have filed or intend to file an SMR
- You suspect or have formed a suspicion about the customer
- AUSTRAC is investigating or may investigate the customer

**Penalties for tipping off are severe** — this is a criminal offence.

**What You CAN Do:**
- Discuss your concerns with your compliance officer
- Seek legal advice (covered by legal professional privilege)
- Continue to provide the service normally (unless declining the relationship)
- File the SMR

**What You CANNOT Do:**
- Tell the customer you've reported them
- Warn the customer that their transaction looks suspicious
- Discuss SMR details with colleagues who don't need to know
- Post about it on social media or discuss publicly

**UI Elements:**
- Interactive internal escalation flowchart
- Decision tree: "Should I file an SMR?" (yes/no questions leading to a recommendation)
- TTR calculator: enter cash amount → tells you if TTR is required
- Tipping-off prohibition highlighted in a red warning box on every reporting page
- Example scenarios for each report type with walkthrough
- Links to AUSTRAC Online

### 7.17 FAQ — EXPANDED

**Purpose:** Answer the most common questions in plain English. Each answer cites the relevant AUSTRAC source.

| # | Question | Short Answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | I only do property management, not sales. Am I affected? | No. Property management is not a designated service under these reforms. |
| 2 | I'm a buyer's agent. Am I affected? | Yes. Brokering the purchase of real estate on behalf of a buyer is a designated service. |
| 3 | I'm a property developer with an in-house sales team. Am I affected? | Yes. Selling real estate directly to customers without an independent agent is a designated service. |
| 4 | Do I need to verify the identity of both buyer and seller? | You must conduct CDD on your customer — the party you are providing the designated service to. If you act for the vendor, the vendor is your customer. If you act for the buyer, the buyer is your customer. |
| 5 | What if my customer refuses to provide ID? | If you cannot complete CDD satisfactorily, you should consider whether to decline or cease providing the service. You may also need to file an SMR if the refusal itself is suspicious. |
| 6 | How much does it cost to enrol with AUSTRAC? | Enrolment with AUSTRAC is free. |
| 7 | Can I use a digital ID verification service? | AUSTRAC guidance permits the use of electronic verification methods as part of CDD, subject to your risk assessment. |
| 8 | What if I suspect money laundering but I'm not sure? | You don't need to be certain. If you have suspicion on reasonable grounds, file an SMR. AUSTRAC would rather receive reports that turn out to be unfounded than miss genuine suspicious activity. |
| 9 | What are the penalties for non-compliance? | Penalties vary depending on the breach. AUSTRAC has stated it will focus enforcement on entities that fail to enrol or make no meaningful compliance effort. Civil penalties can be significant. |
| 10 | Do I need to report every cash transaction? | No — only cash transactions of $10,000 or more (TTR). However, any cash transaction that raises suspicion, regardless of amount, may require an SMR. |
| 11 | Can I outsource my AML/CTF program to a third party? | You can use external consultants to help build your program, and you can appoint an external compliance officer if they meet the eligibility criteria. However, you remain ultimately responsible for compliance. |
| 12 | Does a leasehold count as "real estate" under the reforms? | Only if the leasehold exceeds 30 years. Short-term leases are not captured. |
| 13 | What is the difference between a risk assessment and the AML/CTF program? | The risk assessment is a component of the program. The full program includes the risk assessment plus policies, processes, governance, training, and other elements. |
| 14 | Can I rely on another agent's CDD? | Yes, through a documented reliance arrangement. But you remain responsible for ensuring CDD was properly conducted. |
| 15 | Do I need to screen every customer for sanctions? | Yes — PEP and TFS screening is part of initial CDD for every customer. |

**UI Elements:**
- Searchable accordion list
- Filter by topic (enrolment, CDD, reporting, training, etc.)
- Each answer includes an "AUSTRAC Source" link

## 10. Content Sourcing Rules

To avoid legal risk, all content MUST adhere to these rules:

1. **Only use publicly available AUSTRAC publications** — starter kits, fact sheets, guidance, the AML/CTF Act, and the AML/CTF Rules 2025
2. **Never paraphrase the law** in a way that could be interpreted as legal advice
3. **Always use hedging language** — "you may need to", "consider whether", "AUSTRAC guidance suggests", "according to AUSTRAC"
4. **Never say "you must" as our own assertion** — instead say "AUSTRAC requires reporting entities to..." or "Under the AML/CTF Act, reporting entities are required to..."
5. **Cite sources** — link to the original AUSTRAC page wherever possible
6. **Never collect or process real customer data** — the tool provides template forms for guidance; users fill them in locally
7. **Clearly distinguish the tool from AUSTRAC's starter kit** — the tool complements, not replaces, the official starter kit
8. **Include "last reviewed" dates** on all content sections
9. **Recommend professional advice** wherever the user is making a judgment call

---

## 11. Success Metrics (POC)

| Metric | How to Assess |
|---|---|
| **Completeness** | Does the tool cover all 10 core obligations identified by AUSTRAC? |
| **Alignment** | Does the structure match AUSTRAC's Customise → Implement → Maintain approach? |
| **Accuracy** | Does all content align with current AUSTRAC guidance (as of Feb 2026)? |
| **Clarity** | Can a non-expert complete the risk assessment and CDD forms without external help? |
| **Usability** | Is the UI intuitive on both desktop and mobile? |
| **Form Coverage** | Are all 20 template forms functional and printable? |
| **Quiz Quality** | Do the 15 quiz questions accurately test understanding of key obligations? |
| **Safety** | Does the disclaimer adequately protect the creator from legal liability? |

## 12. Future Enhancements (Post-POC)

| Enhancement | Complexity | Value |
|---|---|---|
| PDF export of completed AML/CTF program | Medium | High |
| Multi-agency support (separate localStorage namespaces) | Low | Medium |
| FATF list auto-update (periodic JSON fetch) | Low | Medium |
| Email/calendar reminders for key dates | High (needs backend) | Medium |
| Integration with AUSTRAC Online | High (needs API) | High |
| AI-powered Q&A chatbot | High (needs API) | High |
| Sector expansion (lawyers, accountants, jewellers) | Medium | High |
| Compliance dashboard for multi-office agencies | High | Medium |
| Digital ID verification integration | High (needs API) | High |
| Audit trail / version history for form entries | Medium | Medium |

---

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Content interpreted as legal advice | Legal liability for creator | Strong disclaimers on every page; hedging language; cite AUSTRAC sources; recommend professional advice |
| AUSTRAC guidance changes after launch | Outdated content leads to non-compliance | Version-stamp all content with "last reviewed" dates; link to source documents; monitor AUSTRAC updates |
| Users rely solely on this tool | Non-compliance if tool is incomplete or outdated | Repeatedly state tool is a complement to the AUSTRAC starter kit, not a replacement; recommend professional advice |
| localStorage cleared accidentally | Lost progress and records | Offer "Export All Data" as JSON download; encourage regular backups; display warning on data section |
| Accessibility issues | Exclusion of users with disabilities | Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines; test with screen readers; ensure keyboard navigation |
| Browser compatibility | Tool doesn't work for some users | Test across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari; use standard APIs only |
| Tool confused with official AUSTRAC product | Misleading users; potential regulatory issue | Clear branding as independent tool; explicit statement that this is not an AUSTRAC product |
