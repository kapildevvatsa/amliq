Escalations

Escalate the client to the AML/CTF compliance officer as soon as practicable if you have:

- ticked YES to any high-risk factors
- identified one of the following not included in the Risk assessment: a kind of client, designated service, method of delivering this service, country, ML/TF risk, method or indicator of criminal activity identified a potential suspicious matter that may need to be reported: give a completed Unusual activity report information form to the AML/CTF compliance officer.

If a client has been escalated to the AML/CTF compliance officer, don't provide them with designated services until you receive approval in line with the Escalation and enhanced customer due diligence policy.

#### A2. Client risk rating

Based on the information you have about the client, assign a risk rating based on the below criteria:

- High – if you’ve answered YES to at least one high risk factor or there are other reasons that suggest the client is high ML/TF risk.
- Medium – if you’ve answered YES to at least two medium risk factors or the information you obtain otherwise warrants this rating.
- Low – where a high or medium risk rating isn’t warranted.

Provide the risk rating and information on the reasons for this rating below.
