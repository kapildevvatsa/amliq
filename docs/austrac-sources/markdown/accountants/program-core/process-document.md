## About this document

This document details the processes and standard operating procedures (SOPs) your practice needs to meet your anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) obligations when using the AML/CTF program starter kit. These processes and SOPs will enable your practice and your personnel to consistently apply AML/CTF processes. The SOPs also set out when to complete relevant forms.

It applies to all designated services your practice provides in Australia, even if your client is overseas.

This document supports and aligns with the Policy document.

## Client risk rating and ongoing customer due diligence process

This process details how to apply an ML/TF risk rating to a client when filling out an Initial customer due diligence form. It also includes how to review their risk rating during your practice relationship with the client.

The process also sets out how to tailor your ongoing customer due diligence (CDD) in line with the ML/TF risk rating, including the level of appropriate ongoing monitoring.

### Applying an ML/TF risk rating

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Start by assessing if any of the medium or high risk factors in the Initial customer due diligence form apply to the client.<br>You can do this by referring to:<br>- information the client provided in the onboarding form or through any other means (for example, as part of enhanced CDD)<br>- other information collected about the client when performing any other processes during initial or ongoing CDD (for example, documents provided by the client, online searches)<br>- the ML/TF risk factors, methods and indicators listed in the Risk assessment<br>- any other information you’re aware of about the client, such as observations about interactions with the client or their representatives.<br>- For any risk factors you believe may apply to the client, select YES in the relevant box. |
|  | Follow the instructions in Section A2 of the initial customer due diligence form to select the appropriate risk rating for the client based on the boxes you marked in the risk factor table above.<br>You’ll need to add up the number of medium and high risk factors where you selected YES. Additionally, you can select a risk rating based on other information you’ve collected which may warrant that rating.<br>For example, where a client’s behaviour matches one of the indicators of unusual or criminal behaviour in the risk assessment but doesn't align with any of the risk factors in the form. |
|  | Detail how you determined the client’s risk rating in the box in Section A2<br>For example, what information did you use to pick the risk rating? For a client who is a politically exposed person (PEP), what position do they hold? |

### Applying risk-based ongoing CDD

As part of your ongoing CDD obligations, you must monitor your client from your first interaction with them until the end of your practice relationship. The table below shows the steps you should take throughout practice relationships with your clients.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Monitor the client’s behaviours during interactions with you and monitor how the client uses your services throughout the practice relationship.<br>Monitor for the following types of activity, any:<br>- unusual transactions and behaviours (refer to the indicators of unusual or criminal behaviour in the Risk assessment)<br>- transactions, behaviours or changes in their client profile which may indicate significant changes in the client’s risk rating (for example, the client requests something which triggers a medium- or high-risk factor where you had previously selected NO, or where one of those risk factors no longer applies)<br>- transactions involving $10,000 or more in physical currency as part of providing a designated service (for example, a client asks you to provide the proceeds of a $50,000 sale in cash)<br>- cross-border movement of physical currency or bearer negotiable instruments (or a combination) valued at $10,000 or more as part of providing a designated service. |
|  | Where any of the activities above occur, use the Escalation triggers and actions process to work out if you need to complete an Escalation form and provide this to the AML/CTF compliance officer. |
|  | In addition to ongoing monitoring, review the following on a periodic basis to see if it's accurate and relevant to the client:<br>- information you collected about the client during initial and ongoing CDD (for example, where your client is located, the reason your client is using your services, their occupation or practice activities)<br>- the risk rating you applied to the client (based on if any of the activities in Step 1 occur)<br>Note: you don't need to perform periodic reviews on clients after your practice relationship with them has ended. |
|  | Where any of the activities in the steps above show that the client’s risk rating may no longer be accurate or relevant, use the steps under ‘1. Applying an ML/TF risk rating’ to determine the client’s current risk rating.<br>If there’s been a change in the client’s information or their risk rating, update this either within the client’s Onboarding form and Initial customer due diligence form or in any other system where you store this information.<br>Note: a change in risk rating may require you to undertake enhanced CDD and request further information from the client. Any further information should be gathered with respect to the Tipping off policy. |

The required level of ongoing monitoring and frequency of periodic reviews changes depending on the client’s risk rating. The difference between each level of risk is in the table below.

| Risk level | Actions during ongoing CDD |
| :--- | :--- |
| Low | Monitor the client’s behaviours and transactions to detect any unusual activity throughout the practice relationship.<br>If the practice relationship lasts longer than 3 years, conduct periodic reviews of information you hold on your client every 3 years (starting from the date you completed initial CDD). |
| Medium | Exercise a higher level of monitoring over the client’s behaviours and transactions than you would for low-risk clients.<br>If the practice relationship lasts longer than 2 years, conduct periodic reviews of information you hold on your client every 2 years (starting from the date you completed initial CDD). |
| High | Exercise a higher level of monitoring over the client’s behaviours and transactions than you would for medium-risk clients.<br>If the practice relationship lasts longer than one year, conduct periodic reviews of information you hold on your client every year (starting from the date you completed initial CDD). |

## Statutory declaration process

This process details how to complete a statutory declaration for personnel who will perform AML/CTF functions, declaring any circumstances that may affect their suitability for the role.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Provide written information to the person that sets out what they must declare.<br>This includes if they:<br>- have been convicted of a serious offence (excluding spent or expunged convictions)<br>- had any other adverse findings against them that may be relevant to their integrity or capability to perform the role (for example dismissed by a previous employer)<br>- have a conflict of interest and, if they do, what they’ll do to manage this conflict of interest<br>- are willing and able to discharge the duties provided in the role description. |
|  | Ask the person to complete the statutory declaration using the information you provided.<br>The person can complete either a [Commonwealth statutory declaration](https://www.ag.gov.au/legal-system/publications/commonwealth-statutory-declaration-form) or a statutory declaration from the state or territory in which they reside. These documents are available online and come with instructions for how they must be filled out. |
|  | Ensure the statutory declaration includes the required information and has been correctly witnessed and signed by an appropriate person. If not, request that the person take the necessary steps to do so.<br>The persons who are allowed to witness a statutory declaration are usually included as an appendix to the document. |
|  | Keep a record of the statutory declaration for at least 7 years. |

## Verify the nature and purpose of the practice relationship process

This process details out how to verify the nature and purpose of a practice relationship as part of carrying out CDD obligations.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Use the Onboarding form to collect information from the client about the nature and purpose of your practice relationship with them.<br>This includes information about why they’re requesting a service from your practice and what the client will do with the services you provide. |
|  | Determine if you can verify the nature and purpose with information already provided by the client. This can be from what you have seen or heard from your interactions with the client, or from the Onboarding form.<br>You can do this by:<br>- comparing the claimed nature and purpose with other information from the client, including their stated occupation, practice activities and other requirements as part of their request<br>- considering if you’d consider the claimed nature or purpose to be normal within the scope of your professional experience.<br>If you cannot verify the nature and purpose based on information already available, go to Step 3.<br>For example, where the service being request doesn't appear to align with what you know about the client and the nature and purpose they’ve provided, you may need to obtain more information to verify the nature and purpose. |
|  | Attempt to confirm the information provided by the client using reliable and independent sources (including documents and online databases) and other sources directly relevant to the client (including their website).<br>For example, does Australian Practice Register data or information from other publicly available sources support the stated practice activities? Does a company client claiming to provide a certain type of service have an online presence (for example, practice website, social media profiles) which matches their claims?<br>If you’re still unable to verify the nature and purpose based off online sources and other documentation, continue to Step 4. |
|  | Ask the client to provide evidence which supports the information they’ve already provided about the nature and purpose of the practice relationship.<br>For example, evidence of the client’s occupation or practice activities, or evidence of what the client intends to do with funds generated from a sale. |

## Source of funds and source of wealth check process

This process details how an AML/CTF compliance officer can establish a client’s source of funds and source of wealth.

### Source of funds

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Ask the client to provide information about where they sourced the funds for the particular transaction or designated service.<br>For example, this may be their salary or wages, or another source, such as the previous sale of a property. |
|  | Collect documents or other forms of evidence from the client which you can use to verify the information provided on reasonable grounds.<br>If the information provided initially is unclear or from an unusual source, ask the client to provide further information. You can explain that this is required under your AML/CTF obligations.<br>Examples of acceptable evidence include:<br>- reliable and independent online sources such as government databases and credible media reporting<br>- a signed letter from the client’s certified practicing accountant confirming their source of funds<br>- a payslip summary or employer letter confirming employment and salary details<br>- a letter from the executor of an estate confirming the distribution of assets to the customer as inheritance<br>- a copy of the sale record or title deed from the sale of property. |
|  | Using the information gathered, consider if you have reason to suspect that:<br>- the client’s funds may have originated from criminal activity<br>- the information provided by the client appears inconsistent with their known profile and financial state<br>- any part of the client’s funds cannot be linked to legitimate sources.<br>If any of the above apply to the client, complete the Unusual activity report review form and submit an SMR to AUSTRAC in the appropriate timeframe (See Policy document for obligations relating to SMR). |

### Source of wealth

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Ask the client to provide information about how they acquired their overall wealth and assets.<br>Most client will have accumulated wealth from multiple sources over time. For example, funds from their salaries, returns from their investments, inheritance. |
|  | Collect documents or other forms of evidence from the client which you can use to verify the information provided on reasonable grounds.<br>If the information provided initially is unclear or from an unusual source, ask the client to provide further information. You can explain that this is required under your AML/CTF obligations.<br>Examples of acceptable evidence include:<br>- reliable and independent online sources such as government databases and credible media reporting<br>- a signed letter from the client’s certified practicing accountant confirming their sources of wealth<br>- pay summaries from current and past employers which indicate wages accumulated over time<br>- a letter from the executor of an estate confirming the distribution of assets to the client as inheritance<br>- a copy of the sale record or title deed from the sale of property. |
|  | Using the information gathered, consider if you have reason to suspect that:<br>- the client’s wealth may have originated from criminal activity<br>- the information provided by the client appears inconsistent with their known profile and financial state<br>- part of the client’s wealth is explainable from legitimate sources, but most of it is not<br>If any of the above apply to the client complete the Unusual activity report review form and submit an SMR to AUSTRAC in the appropriate timeframe (See Policy document for obligations relating to SMR). |

## Sanctions check process

The process details how to check if a client is designated for targeted financial sanctions.

### Personnel carrying out a sanctions check

| Steps | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Download the latest version of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) Consolidated List (the List). It contains a list of all current persons sanctioned by Australia.<br>Note:<br>- As of January 2026, there are only a small number of individuals who hold Australian citizenship who are on the Consolidated List. These individuals either currently reside overseas or are in detention.<br>- Sanctions checks should therefore be a priority for any individuals who do not hold Australian citizenship.<br>- You should regularly check for updates to the Consolidated List in case changes occur. You can subscribe to receive email updates from DFAT when changes are made to the List. |
|  | Search for the person’s name in the List to identify any exact or close matches.<br>If a potential match is found, compare other details you have against details in the List to determine if the person you’re dealing with is sanctioned, such as address, citizenship and place of birth.<br>For certain persons, the List may contain other information such as previous names, membership in organisations, document numbers, and other details. |
|  | If the person is a close match for a person appearing on the List:<br>- stop engaging with the client immediately<br>- don't provide services to the client<br>- don't deal with their assets<br>- don't return any assets which are currently under your control.<br>You can find more information about how to deal with sanctioned individuals or entities on the DFAT website. |
|  | Escalate the matter using the Escalation triggers and actions and Escalation form, notifying the AML/CTF compliance officer immediately. |
|  | Document all sanctions checks performed in the relevant Initial customer due diligence form, including:<br>- details about the client and the sanctioned individual or entity<br>- the ‘last updated’ date of the List that contained the match<br>- screening results (include a copy of the DFAT list used)<br>- any actions taken by the practice. |

### Responding to a positive sanctions check

| Steps | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Review the Escalation form and document findings using the Escalations register confirming the positive match. |
|  | After you confirm a positive match for sanctions:<br>- inform the senior manager(s) and governing body<br>- stop all client activity and freeze any client assets under the control of the practice<br>- notify the Australian Sanctions Office and Australian Federal Police.<br>You can find more information about how to deal with sanctioned individuals or entities on the DFAT website. |

## Politically exposed persons check process

This process sets out how to identify if an individual is a current or former politically exposed person (PEP) as part of initial or ongoing customer due diligence. You must conduct PEP checks on:

- the client (if they’re an individual)
- anyone representing the client
- all beneficial owners of the client.

| Steps | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Review the client’s onboarding form and if they've disclosed that they are, or any representatives or beneficial owners are:<br>- a domestic PEP<br>- a foreign PEP<br>- an international organisation PEP<br>- a related person of a domestic, foreign or international organisation PEP. |
|  | If an individual client or other related individual has disclosed that they are or have formerly been a PEP:<br>- search the name of the individual and any other information provided to verify the claim and determine which type of PEP they are or were.<br>- review relevant articles, webpages, news items, and other sources returned by the search prompts.<br>Assess up to the first 3 pages of results.<br>If you’re unable to find evidence of the individual’s PEP status, ask the client to provide supporting information, such as:<br>- an official website listing their current or former position<br>- documentation from an official government agency, international organisation, or other relevant organisation. |
|  | For any other individuals, you need to conduct an online search for those individuals to check that they’re not, or have never been, a PEP.<br>You can do this by searching for the individual’s name with other terms included referring to different types of PEPs (refer to Appendix B of the Onboarding form for a list of PEPs).<br>- For example, ‘[name] AND [government] OR [politics] OR [parliament] OR [court] OR [military] OR [administration] OR [diplomat] OR [state-owned] OR [international]’<br>If the individual has foreign citizenship, residency, or is affiliated with any foreign country, include the country or location in the search terms.<br>Review relevant articles, webpages, news items and other sources returned by the search prompts. Assess up to the first 3 pages of results.<br>Assess if the information you’ve identified indicates that any of the individuals are, or have been, a domestic, foreign or international organisation PEP. |
|  | If you identify that:<br>- the person is a foreign PEP – they are a high risk client and you will need to complete the enhanced CDD form<br>- the person did not tell the truth about their PEP status – consider whether this was intentional or a mistake.<br>If you believe this is intentional, this is an unusual matter that you must either:<br>- escalate to your compliance officer using the unusual activity report information form or<br>- if you are the compliance officer – determine if this is a suspicious matter that must be reported to AUSTRAC by using the unusual activity report review form. |
|  | Document the results of PEP checks performed in the Initial customer due diligence form, including:<br>- the search terms used<br>- the sources reviewed in making the assessment<br>- outcomes of the checks. |

## Adverse media check process

This process sets out how to check for adverse (negative) media associated with your clients or personnel.

Use this process to help you determine:

- For personnel – their suitability to hold a particular AML/CTF role
- For clients, their representatives, their beneficial owners and persons on whose behalf the client is receiving the designated service – the client’s ML/TF risk rating and if there is suspicious behaviour.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Use a public search engine and apply the following search parameters:<br>- “[the person’s full name] AND fraud OR corruption OR crime OR arrest OR scandal OR investigation OR lawsuit OR conviction OR bribery OR money laundering OR terrorist OR sanctions”<br>Check search results for up to 3 pages. |
|  | Examine any relevant articles, pages or news links identified in the search, excluding results that clearly do not relate to person being searched.<br>Compare the search results against the information already collected for the person to confirm if they relate to the same individual. |
|  | Determine if the media sources being used are reliable and independent. This includes, but isn't limited to, media articles that refer to:<br>- settled criminal convictions<br>- charges<br>- executed law enforcement powers<br>- arrests<br>- findings of fact in civil proceedings verified through official court of government references.<br>Don’t consider any spent or expunged convictions. |
|  | Consider the context and relevance of any reports. Are the alleged offences a type that could generate significant profits? For example:<br>- money laundering<br>- fraud or corruption<br>- financial crimes<br>- drug trafficking<br>- people smuggling<br>- other serious or organised crimes.<br>Place lower weight on minor or non-profit-generating offences, or offences that are less likely to alter the level of ML/TF risk (such as drink driving).<br>Consider any relevant findings of misconduct or other activity. |
|  | If you identify that the person has allegedly committed a significant profit-generating offence or there is another significant finding from adverse media.<br>For personnel – treat this as a factor that may affect their suitability to hold a particular AML/CTF role.<br>For clients, their representatives and their beneficial owners – treat this as a factor for their ML/TF risk rating and if you're required to submit a suspicious matter report to AUSTRAC. |

## Identify personnel process

This process sets out the steps to verify the identity of personnel during personnel due diligence.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Use the Personnel due diligence form to obtain the following information from the person:<br>- legal name<br>- any other names they’re known by<br>- date of birth<br>- residential address<br>- unique identifier (license or passport number)<br>- expiry date related to the unique identifier (if any).<br>You may already hold this information in your systems, otherwise, you can collect it directly from the person with their consent. |
|  | Obtain an original or reliable copy (physical or electronic) of one of the following types of documents to verify their identity:<br>- Option 1: one primary photographic identification document<br>- Option 2: two primary non-photographic identification documents along with a referee statement<br>- Option 3: one primary non-photographic identification document and a secondary identification document, along with a referee statement.<br>Check the document against the identifying information provided to make sure they’re consistent.<br>If the person can’t provide these documents, establish their identity using the alternative identification documents in Annexure A. |
|  | Confirm the person is who they claim to be.<br>If the person has provided photo identification, check their appearance against the photo provided.<br>If the person has provided non-photographic identification documents, examine the reference material provided. |
|  | If you identify any inconsistencies, ask the person to provide additional identification documents to resolve the inconsistency. |

- the individual’s circumstances that have resulted in limited access to identification documents
- a brief explanation of the reasons why the individual has inconsistent details on their identification.

## Beneficial ownership process

This process details how to trace and identify how a non-individual client is owned and controlled. The process includes identifying every entity and beneficial owner in the ownership and control chain and tracing it back to the individuals who ultimately own or control the client (see possible beneficial owners).

#### Steps

The process starts from the client entity, analysing how they’re owned and controlled, including through layers of intermediate entities.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Ask the client for a flow chart (or similar document) showing how the entity is owned and controlled.<br>- The document should show all entities and beneficial owners in the ownership and control chain, and ultimately to the individuals who own or control the client.<br>- Use steps 2 to 5 to verify the information provided by the client. |
|  | Collect initial documents for the relevant kind of client ([see Documents for each entity type](#documents-for-each-entity-type) below)<br>Ask the client for original documents or reliable copies and extracts that show ownership and control, such as:<br>- a company extract (lists directors and shareholders)<br>- a partnership agreement<br>- a trust deed<br>- an existing ownership and control chart certified by a qualified professional (including a solicitor or certified practicing accountant).<br>If a document collected may be subject to change (for example, extracts from the ASIC Company Register), the document should be no more than 6 months old.<br>Request further documents with details of changes made (for example, deeds of variation, ASIC change of officeholder forms).<br>Where documents are unavailable or unclear, ask for alternative independent documents and record the reason.<br>Keep copies of all documents collected for your records. |
|  | Verify if the documents submitted are:<br>- original documents, or reliable copies or extracts of the original document<br>- current (or not more than 6 months old if the information could be subject to change)<br>- originate from an independent and reliable source (for example, government register)<br>Where documents are certified, note that certification confirms only that the copy matches the information on the document presented.<br>If you’re unsure of the authenticity or accuracy of a document, you may wish to verify this by requesting:<br>- the original document<br>- all variations/amendments in chronological order<br>- third-party confirmation from the individual who drafted the document or other professional who can certify the contents<br>If there are still doubts about the document’s authenticity, consider if this is unusual and if you should fill out an Unusual activity report information form.<br>Where necessary, cross-check information provided against other documents (if available) or online sources.<br>Record verification outcomes, including:<br>- all documents provided and their source<br>- how you verified those documents<br>- any limitations or issues identified in those documents. |
|  | Identify and trace all individuals and entities who own or control the client, including through shareholdings, voting rights, practical influence and ability to appoint or remove directors or trustees.<br>A list of common owners and controllers for each entity type can be found below. Refer to ‘Possible beneficial owners’ in the Supporting information section below.<br>Where it has been determined that the client is:<br>- a listed public company subject to public disclosure requirements (for example, ASX) – end the process and document your findings<br>- a subsidiary of a listed public company subject to public disclosure requirements (for example, ASX) – continue the process until you reach the listed public company then end the process and document your findings. |
|  |   - If any owner or controller is another entity (for example, another company or trust), repeat Steps 1 to 3 for each intermediary entity.<br>Keep tracing through each layer until you’ve identified and documented all individuals who ultimately own or control the client. |
|  | Document findings by mapping out the ownership and control structure of your client in the Initial customer due diligence form. This can be done by creating a simple flow chart or table with the details of each entity and individual within the structure. This should include a detailed breakdown outlining:<br>- each ownership layer, including a breakdown by percentage of ownership of the client<br>- each beneficial owner with ownership and aggregated ownership percentage<br>- each beneficial owner and the way they control the client<br>- clearly label nominee arrangements (for example, ‘Nominee for [Name]’) |
|  | Identify if any parts of the ownership and control structure align with risk factors in the Risk assessment, such as:<br>- nominee arrangements (for example, shareholders or directors)<br>- offshore entities<br>- complex ownership.<br>Where a nominee arrangement is identified, don't treat the nominee as the beneficial owner. Attribute the ownership or control to the underlying beneficial owner and request written confirmation from the nominee declaring the person they’re acting for. |
|  | Use the ownership and control structure to determine if there are any individuals who directly or indirectly own 25% or more of the client.<br>To do this, calculate beneficial ownership for each individual by multiplying ownership percentages through each layer of ownership.<br>If a person appears in more than one path, add up their percentages to calculate their ownership of the client.<br>For example:<br>- Company A is 50% owned by Company B.<br>- Company B is 60% owned by Person X.<br>- Person X’s ownership of Company A: 50% x 60% = 30%.<br>- Person X is a beneficial owner of Company A because they own more than 25%.<br>Cross-check your calculations against the documents from Step 1 to make sure they’re correct. |
|  | Use the ownership and control structure to determine if any individual exercises control of the client, regardless of ownership percentage. This includes through decision-making authority or influence.<br>For example, the trustee of a trust exercises control over a trust through their position, rather than by ‘owning’ the trust.<br>For reference, use the tables below under possible owners and controllers and documents for each entity type below (for example, a director, senior manager, or trustee). |
|  | If no beneficial owners can be identified through Steps 8 and 9, or if none exist, you must:<br>- identify and verify the CEO (or equivalent senior officer) for the client<br>- record the steps you took to identify beneficial owners, along with the reason why they couldn't be established. |
|  | Document all findings in the Initial customer due diligence form and keep records of any workings while determining the beneficial owners. |

## Update country risk and risk ratings process

This process outlines the steps to update your Country: Risk assessment in the Risk assessment.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | In the Countries: Risk assessment table in the Risk assessment, list all the countries your practice deals with, or chooses not to deal with, when providing designated services.<br>Consider all the following persons (including individuals, body corporates or legal arrangements):<br>- Your client<br>- Any beneficial owner of your client, person on whose behalf they are receiving the designated service (such as beneficiaries to a trust) or any person acting on their behalf.<br>The countries you deal with will be, for the above persons:<br>- for individuals – their country of residency and the country in which they are physically located when the designated service was provided<br>- for body corporates and legal arrangements – where they were formed or registered<br>- any country you deal with in providing designated services to clients (such as where a domestic client requests funds to be transferred to a bank account in another country). |
|  | Go to the [Basel AML Index](https://index.baselgovernance.org/) website and find the Basel AML Index score for each country listed in Step 1, recording the score in your country risk table.<br>Assign a risk rating based on the Basel score using the system below, entering the risk rating for each country in the ‘Basel AML risk rating’ column of the table:<br>Note: Not all countries are listed on the Basel AML Index. |
|  | Check each country listed in Step 1 against the list of countries identified as high risk by the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions.html) or are subject to sanctions listed by the [Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/sanctions-regimes-currently-implemented-under-australian-sanction-law).<br>In the ‘High-risk country column’, mark ‘Yes’ if the country appears on any of the lists or ‘No’ if it doesn’t.<br>In the Final country risk rating column:<br>- If you marked ‘Yes’, assign a high-risk rating. This overrides the Basel rating.<br>- If you marked ‘No’, use the Basel AML risk rating recorded in step 2.<br>Review your entries for accuracy and completeness.<br>Note: If a country doesn’t appear on the Basel AML Index or in either of the FATF or DFAT lists, consider the materials underpinning the [Basel Index methodology](https://index.baselgovernance.org/methodology) and assign a reasonable risk rating based on these materials. |
|  | Determine your risk appetite by considering the size of your practice, the services you provide, the clients you deal with and your ability to apply controls.<br>Your risk appetite should be realistic and capable of being applied consistently in practice.<br>Record your decision by selecting YES or NO in the ‘Risk appetite’ column.<br>If you select NO for a risk factor, you must apply controls to reduce or avoid exposure to that risk.<br>This could include not providing services, or limiting services, to clients that with the risk factor. Record these controls in the last column. |
|  | If you select YES for a risk factor, you must apply controls to manage the risk.<br>Update the endnotes that identify medium and high risk countries at the bottom each relevant Initial customer due diligence forms, or the corresponding section of your existing workflows, to ensure the new risk factor is considered when assessing client risk.<br>Update, if necessary, relevant Onboarding forms, to ensure that information is collected which allows you to detect those risk factors. |
|  | Seek and record approval for all updates and changes using the maintain your AML/CTF program form |
|  | Once updates are approved, communicate changes to all affected personnel as soon as practicable and provide training if required.<br>Keep the previous version of the Risk assessment for at least 7 years from the date of the change. |

Example: Adding a new high-risk foreign country as a new risk factor

An accountant gets a request from a client for assistance with a real estate transaction in a high-risk foreign country. The staff member recognises this is unusual, and that this high-risk foreign country isn’t listed in the risk assessment. The staff member submits an escalation form to the AML/CTF compliance officer.

The AML/CTF compliance officer reviews the referral and confirms that this foreign country isn’t assessed in the agency’s risk assessment.

Using the Update country risk rating process, the AML/CTF compliance officer finds:

- The Basel AML Index provides a score of 7.50 for this country

Based on this information, the AML/CTF compliance officer:

1. adds the country to the Country risk assessment table
2. includes the high-risk rating and a decision on the practice’s risk appetite related to dealing with this country.

## Updating inherent risk and risk ratings process

This process details how to add or reassess an inherent risk or risk factor in your Risk assessment and how to determine the appropriate rating. This process excludes country risk ratings.

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Identify the risk – an inherent risk or risk factor requiring reassessment, re-rating or adding to the Risk assessment may be identified:<br>- before you provide a new or changed designated service<br>- before a significant change occurs to a delivery channel, client type or country<br>- with changes in new or emerging technologies<br>- during periodic reviews<br>- as part of an independent evaluation<br>- through AUSTRAC communications, updates to the national risk assessments (NRA) and other risk products<br>- through the Escalation form submitted by client-facing personnel. |
|  | As a starting point, identify if the inherent risk has already been rated in the most recent NRAs. These are linked in the ‘risk assessment sources’ section of the risk assessment.<br>Adjust the rating if your practice may be exposed to that inherent risk or risk factor when providing designated services.<br>For example, where other regulations affecting your sector prohibit dealing with a certain type of client or payment method, the inherent risk for your practice may be lower.<br>If the risk isn’t covered in a recent NRA:<br>- search the AUSTRAC website for relevant information<br>- check reliable international sources, such as [FATF guidance materials](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html), for additional risk insights.<br>When rating the risk, consider if the risk may assist criminals in any of the following when using your services:<br>- concealing the identity, source of wealth or source of funds of a person<br>- making it easier to access and use<br>- allowing value to be more easily raised, moved or stored through your services<br>- otherwise, allowing your services to be exploited for the purposes of ML/TF. |
|  | Update the risk assessment by adding the new or reassessed risk factor, inherent risk or risk rating to the relevant section of your Risk assessment.<br>Include the details required by the table. |
|  | Determine your risk appetite by considering the size of your practice, the services you provide, the clients you deal with and your ability to apply controls when providing services.<br>Your risk appetite should be realistic and capable of being applied consistently in practice.<br>Record your decision by selecting YES or NO in the Risk appetite column of the relevant Risk factors section.<br>If you select NO for a risk factor, you must apply controls to reduce or avoid exposure to that risk. This could include not providing or limiting services to those clients or requiring clients to use alternative methods designed to mitigate that risk.<br>Record these controls in the last column of the inherent risk or risk factor in the risk assessment. |
|  | If you select YES for a risk factor, you must apply controls to manage the risk.<br>- Update Section A1 of each relevant Initial customer due diligence forms, or the corresponding section of your existing workflows, to ensure the new risk factor is taken into account when assessing client risk.<br>- Update, if necessary, relevant Onboarding forms, to ensure that information is collected which allows you to detect those risk factors. |
|  | Seek approval, record for all updates and changes by following the Maintain your AML/CTF program form |
|  | Once updates are approved, communicate changes to all affected personnel as soon as practicable and provide training if required.<br>Keep the previous version of the Risk assessment for at least 7 years from the date of the change. |

#### Example: Reviewing if a new client type as a new risk factor

After receiving an instruction, an accountant starts to collect information from the client. The client indicates they intend to use a ‘foundation’ registered in an offshore jurisdiction. The accountant recognises their practice has never dealt with a foundation before, and that this entity type may not be covered in the risk assessment. The accountant submits an escalation form to the AML/CTF compliance officer.

The AML/CTF compliance officer reviews the referral and confirms that foundations aren’t specifically assessed in the practice’s risk assessment.

Using the NRAs and reliable materials from international bodies such as the FATF, the AML/CTF compliance officer finds:

- These foundations are like a body corporate in Australia, but with other features which resemble a trust.
- Foundations from this country are often used for asset protection purposes and have been previously associated with offshore tax evasion schemes.

Based on this information, the AML/CTF compliance officer:

- Adds foundations as a client risk factor in the risk assessment, with a description of the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with this type of client.
- Includes a risk rating and a decision on the practice’s risk appetite related to dealing with this kind of client.

## AUSTRAC communications process

This process details the steps for receiving, assessing and actioning communications from AUSTRAC.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | The AML/CTF compliance officer will:<br>- list themselves as the contact person through [AUSTRAC Online](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/austrac-online).<br>- subscribe to [AUSTRAC guidance updates](https://www.austrac.gov.au/news-and-media/subscribe-to-updates) and [AUSTRAC InBrief](https://www.austrac.gov.au/news-and-media/austrac-inbrief/form). |
|  | If any other personnel receive or identify any communications directly from AUSTRAC, such as a letter, they must forward it to the AML/CTF compliance officer as soon as practicable. |
|  | Review the communication to determine if it’s relevant to the practice’s ML/TF risks.<br>If so, review the Risk assessment and affected parts of the AML/CTF program to identify if updates are needed.<br>Record the communication in the table under Risk assessment sources in the Risk assessment. |
|  | If updates are needed, draft proposed changes in line with the maintain our AML/CTF program policy and maintain your AML/CTF program form. Continue to Step 4.<br>If no updates are needed, document that the communication was considered and the reason no updated are needed. This process is then complete. |
|  | Submit any proposed changes to the senior manager for review and approval before implementation.<br>If the senior manager rejects proposed changes, record the reasoning and follow the process outlined in Section 4 of the Maintain your AML/CTF program form. |
|  | Once approved, update the relevant documents, and systems and controls.<br>Make sure updates are published and accessible to personnel.<br>Provide communication and training to personnel if required. |

## Independent evaluation process

This process sets out the steps for arranging, conducting and finalising an independent evaluation of the AML/CTF program.

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Appoint a qualified and independent evaluator (see Independent evaluations in the Maintain our AML/CTF program policy).<br>Provide the evaluator with access to relevant AML/CTF policies, systems and records. |
|  | The evaluator reviews the AML/CTF program against legal obligations and effectiveness, providing a written report with findings and recommendations. |
|  | The evaluator submits the report directly to the senior manager, and if separate, to the governing body. The senior manager and governing body must review the report as soon as practicable.<br>If there are no adverse findings, go to Step 8. |
|  | Use the Independent evaluation response form to address any adverse findings. If findings:<br>- aren’t accepted – document the rationale in writing<br>- are accepted – develop an action plan. |
|  | Senior manager and governing body develop and document an action plan that:<br>- categorises findings<br>- assigns each finding to an appropriate personnel member<br>- defines actions, timelines and responsibilities. |
|  | Implement action items and record actions using the Maintain your AML/CTF program form<br>Follow the action plan to make updates to the AML/CTF program.<br>Submit the updated AML/CTF program to the senior manager for approval.<br>Implement approved updates and provide personnel training if required.<br>Save evaluation reports, action plans, forms and correspondence in the compliance records folder. |
|  | Test implemented updates to confirm they’re effective.<br>Provide a written update to the senior manager and governing body.<br>If updates are ineffective, investigate and repeat the process from Step 5 until effective. |
|  | Once the evaluation is complete and, if applicable, all findings have been addressed, close the evaluation process and save all records in the compliance records folder.<br>Add the next evaluation due date in a compliance calendar or register. |

## Annual compliance report process

This process details the steps for completing and submitting an annual compliance report (ACR) to AUSTRAC.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Make sure that the contact email is up to date in AUSTRAC Online. They will be notified about the compliance report.<br>Schedule a reminder to prepare the report at the start of each calendar year. |
|  | When notified by AUSTRAC, review the compliance report preview questions to prepare. |
|  | When the reporting period opens on 1 January:<br>- determine if information is needed from other teams and practice areas.<br>- gather information required to complete the report.<br>- complete the report questions. It doesn’t need to be completed in one sitting. |
|  | Review and submit the report, checking the report for accuracy and completeness.<br>Submit to AUSTRAC by 31 March via AUSTRAC Online and provide a copy to the governing body.<br>Keep a record of the report for at least 7 years from the date submitted. |

## Escalating matters to the AML/CTF compliance officer process

This process details:

- matters that need to be escalated to the AML/CTF compliance officer
- how to escalate the matter
- what the AML/CTF compliance officer must do to action the escalated matter.

The steps you take under this process will depend on whether the escalation trigger is detected:

- by the AML/CTF compliance officer – Just follow the steps in ‘how to action for the compliance officer’ except those that relate to reviewing escalated information (you will have received this information yourself)
- by another person – Escalate to the compliance officer by following the steps at ‘how to escalate’. The compliance officer then actions by following the steps at ‘how to action for the compliance officer’.

Where an action, process or form does not mention a timeframe, you must complete it as soon as practicable.

### Escalation triggers and actions

The table below sets out triggers for escalation, and the actions that must be taken to escalate matters to the AML/CTF compliance officer for review and actioning.

| Escalation trigger | How to escalate | How to action for the AML/CTF compliance officer |
