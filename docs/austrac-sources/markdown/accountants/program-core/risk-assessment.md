## Risk assessment

Your practice needs to have a money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing (we refer to these as ML/TF) risk assessment.

A risk assessment will help your practice identify and assess the ML/TF risks about the:

- services you provide
- clients and jurisdictions you deal with
- delivery channels you use to provide services.

These inform how you develop other processes in your anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) program by ensuring that controls are proportionate to the level of risk you identify.

Under this system, a client will have either a:

- High risk rating – where at least one high ML/TF risk factor is present or the information you have otherwise warrants this rating. For example, indicators from this risk assessment suggest a customer isn't who they claim to be.
- Medium risk rating – where there are at least 2 medium ML/TF risk factors present or the information you have otherwise warrants this rating (moderate vulnerabilities to ML/TF present).
- Low risk rating – a high or medium ML/TF risk rating isn't warranted under the tests above.

You will also need to update this risk assessment to reflect changes in ML/TF risk (refer to your Maintain you AML/CTF program policy).

### Risk ratings overview

These ratings and descriptions are used throughout the risk assessment.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| High | Represents significant potential ML/TF impact, major damage or effect. Potentially involving serious money laundering, terrorism or proliferation activity. Requires strong and proactive controls. Controls include:<br>- enhanced client due diligence (CDD)<br>- gathering more information about the client at onboarding (as simplified CDD can’t be used)<br>- ongoing monitoring<br>- more frequent periodic reviews (every year). |
| Medium | Represents moderate potential ML/TF impact with a potential for adverse outcomes if controls do not appropriately manage and mitigate the risk. Controls include:<br>- gathering more information about the client at onboarding (as simplified CDD can’t be used)<br>- ongoing monitoring<br>- periodic reviews every 2 years. |
| Low | Represents minor or negligible potential ML/TF impact, with limited inherent exposure which can be easily contained. Can be managed effectively through standard policies including simplified CDD on onboarding, monitoring and periodic reviews every 3 years. |

The ratings have been reached by considering different risk factors which may make your practice vulnerable to exploitation. This is how easily criminals could exploit your designated services to launder money, finance terrorist acts or obtain weapons of mass destruction.

To do this, we’ve considered whether your designated services:

- could be exploited to conceal the identity or source of wealth or source of funds of a person
- could be easily accessed and used
- could allow value to be raised, moved or stored
- are known to be exploited by criminals.

To create your risk assessment, you need to understand the inherent risks and other risk factors associated with providing your designated services.

Based on the sources listed below (see [Risk assessment sources](#risk-assessment-sources)), we’ve provided a list of inherent risks and risk factors known to be relevant to sectors which provide professional services. The risk factors and ratings set out in the risk assessment have been used to develop the controls and processes which form the rest of the AML/CTF program.

Other elements of the program will draw directly on these risk factors to sort your clients into low, medium and high ML/TF risk categories. More thorough checks will apply to higher risk clients.

### Money laundering: Inherent risk

|  | The 2024 money laundering national risk assessment assesses money laundering vulnerabilities for both accountants and trust and company service providers. As the vulnerabilities for both groups apply to the designated services in this risk assessment, inherent risks for both groups have been provided here. |
| --- | --- |

Australia’s 2024 money laundering national risk assessment assesses:

- accountants as posing a high and stable vulnerability to money laundering
- trust and company service providers as posing a medium and stable vulnerability to money laundering.

It’s expected that:

- accountants will continue to pose a high vulnerability to money laundering due to their work across the financial system and because they provide services desired by criminals
- trust and company service providers will continue to pose a medium vulnerability to money laundering because their services and expertise are desired by criminals.

#### Accountants

Australian authorities identify accountants as key facilitators in money laundering. Accountants can facilitate money laundering schemes by:

- creating and using complex and multi-layered corporate structures and registered companies to layer illicit funds
- moving large volumes of money rapidly through multiple company accounts
- obscuring and falsifying the source of structured cash deposits
- obscuring parties to a transaction where trust accounts are used

Accountants’ vulnerability to money laundering is elevated by the risk profile of clients and transactions. This is especially the case where cash-intensive businesses or complex transactions involving multiple jurisdictions and high-risk clients are involved.

Accountants can assist in crimes such as tax evasion and fraud that create illicit funds, as well as enabling the laundering of these proceeds. This is because accountants and tax agents don’t have the same obligations as legal professionals to audit and reconcile client-trust accounts. Although, accountants who are members of professional bodies are required by accounting standards to follow strict rules when handling money from clients, including audits of that account.

| Risk rating | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| High | The accounting sector is highly vulnerable to money laundering when providing particular high-risk services. |

#### Trust and company service providers

Trust and company service providers are often exploited by criminals due to their expertise in wealth protection and the administration of trust and company structures. Whether they’re complicit or non-complicit, they create further distance between a criminal and their illicit proceeds.

Although companies can generally be set up without a trust and company service provider, the creation of more complex legal structures, including trusts, often requires the expertise of trust and company service providers. These structures are highly attractive to criminals as they:

- make it hard to determine beneficial ownership
- conceal the origin and purpose of financial transactions
- move significant volumes of funds domestically and offshore.

As more sophisticated criminals consistently exploit these mechanisms, trust and company service providers remain vulnerable to enabling money laundering.

Many of the established methodologies used to conceal wealth, circumvent financial obligations and ultimately launder money are enhanced by a trust and company service provider. Key methodologies include:

- establishing corporate structures in jurisdictions with lax regulatory and legislative frameworks, including secrecy jurisdictions
- creating complex chains of companies across multiple jurisdictions
- appointing dummy directors and shareholders
- acting as trustees on behalf of a client
- providing loans secured by client funds.

| Risk rating | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Medium | Trust and company service providers are vulnerable to money laundering due to the services they provide and their attractiveness to criminals. |

### Terrorism financing: Inherent risk

Accountants are more commonly used to launder money rather than fund terrorism. However, those services related to trust and company formation and the handling of client funds are internationally recognised as being attractive to those seeking to distance themselves from fundraising towards terrorism.

Most terrorism financing cases involve simple unsophisticated methods such as low value client-to-client transfers. More complex cases are rare, for example, those involving efforts to obscure beneficial ownership using legitimate or shell companies or third-country transfers. In these instances, it’s often difficult to definitively link the transaction to terrorism financing.

Accountants may be involved in either:

- setting up charities or other non-profit organisations (NPOs)
- providing other services to the charity.

Registered charities and legitimate NPOs provide an attractive channel for terrorism financing. This is because donations can be solicited from many individuals, witting and unwitting, and diverted for illicit purposes.

| Risk rating | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Low | The use of accountants to facilitate terrorism financing is believed to be uncommon but can occur when assisting exploited NPOs or providing trust and company services. |

### Proliferation financing: Inherent risk

The 2024 proliferation financing (PF) national risk assessment found that criminals seeking to finance the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction exploit accountants the same way as money launderers. They do this by using accountants to:

- establish complex corporate structures, such as shell or front companies
- create banking arrangements to evade sanctions and generate revenue for proliferation.

While the extent of criminal exploitation for these purposes is likely low, accountants remain exposed to the risk of being taken advantage of by criminals for proliferation financing.

| Risk rating | Risk rating | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | Accountants are vulnerable to exploitation by criminals engaging in proliferation activities when helping create corporate structures which distance them from illicit funds. | Accountants are vulnerable to exploitation by criminals engaging in proliferation activities when helping create corporate structures which distance them from illicit funds. |

| Assisting a person in the planning or execution of a transaction to buy, sell or transfer a body corporate or legal arrangement.<br>This includes acting on their behalf in a transaction.<br>This only applies where the sale, purchase or transfer relates to a controlling interest in the body corporate or legal arrangement.<br>(Item 2 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | Accountants are routinely asked to help with transactions to buy, sell or transfer a body corporate or legal arrangement. This typically involves:<br>- preparing and reviewing contracts<br>- conducting due diligence<br>- obtaining relevant government approvals<br>- preparing financial settlements or documents.<br>This doesn’t include transactions following, or resulting from, an order of a court or tribunal.<br>A body corporate can include a person, association or group of persons incorporated into a corporation.<br>A legal arrangement can include a structured agreement or setup recognised by law. It often involves trusts, contracts, or similar frameworks that define rights, duties, or relationships between parties. | Criminals can exploit both body corporates such as companies, and legal arrangements such as trusts. This can include:<br>- using complex ownership structures or rapid ownership transfers to obscure ownership<br>- as vehicles to conceal beneficiaries and source of funds<br>- to assist in integrating illicit funds into the legitimate economy (for example, laundering proceeds of crime through a cash-intensive business)<br>- to move proceeds of crime overseas. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Receiving, holding, controlling or managing a person’s money, accounts, securities or securities accounts, virtual assets, or other property as part of assisting the person in the planning or execution of a transaction.<br>This includes acting for or on behalf of a person in a transaction.<br>(Item 3 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | This may include:<br>- managing sale proceeds or purchase funds for a client on escrow<br>- money or property being held by an accountant prior to being settled as trust property on the creation of an express trust<br>- having authority to make payments over a client’s bank or securities account on behalf of the client, including under a power of attorney.<br>Accountants operating trust accounts in the absence of any other designated services aren’t covered. | Criminals can exploit accountants in several ways, including to:<br>- hide behind their accountants by using them to manage illegally gained funds for purchases and expenses on their behalf<br>- integrate illegal funds into the legitimate economy<br>- store value from criminal proceeds<br>- obscure the origin of the money, accounts, and assets through a complex transaction. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Assisting in organising, planning or executing a transaction for equity or debt financing relating to a body corporate or legal arrangement.<br>This includes acting on the person’s behalf in a transaction.<br>(Item 4 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | Helping with equity or debt financing can typically include:<br>- supporting a business to raise capital or debt through various methods, such as initial public offerings, venture capital, share purchase plans, debt financing, bonds, asset financing, loans and debentures<br>- services directly advancing a transaction to secure equity and debt financing for the company relating to negotiating, structuring and executing a financing deal or the drafting of debt or equity finance documents. | Criminals can exploit accountants for equity and debt financing in several ways, including using them to:<br>- manage illegally gained funds<br>- purchase equity in a business<br>- assist in complex debt financing applications (often commingling them with legitimately sourced funds to pay back the debt)<br>- manipulate the value of shares to quickly launder money<br>- create loan back schemes to launder money. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Selling or transferring a shelf company.<br>(Item 5 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | This involves either establishing, selling or transferring a previously established shelf company. | Criminals often prefer purchasing shelf companies as opposed to forming new companies, particularly where the registration date is earlier than when it was used for any purpose (legitimate or illegitimate).<br>Shelf companies are commonly used by criminals in the same way as ‘shell companies’, which are companies with no real assets or business operations. However, shelf companies registered in the past may seem more legitimate than a newly formed company when trying to open a bank account or send proceeds of crime overseas. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Assisting in planning or executing in the creation or restructuring of a body corporate or legal arrangement. This includes acting on the person’s behalf.<br>(Item 6 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | This routinely involves:<br>- supporting merger and acquisitions by drafting, reviewing and negotiating preparatory documents, including partnership agreements, company constitutions, trust deeds or documents<br>- registering applications and forms with ASIC. For example, to register a company or a business name<br>- obtaining Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approvals, ASX and ASIC waivers. | Criminals can exploit both body corporates and legal arrangements in several ways, including:<br>- by using complex ownership structures to obscure ownership<br>- as vehicles to conceal beneficiaries and source of funds<br>- to integrate illegal funds into the legitimate economy<br>- by using loan back schemes to launder money. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Acting as a director or secretary of a company, a power of attorney of a body corporate or legal arrangement, a partner in a partnership, a trustee of an express trust, or any other functionally equivalent position on behalf of a person.<br>This includes arranging for another person to act in these roles.<br>(Item 7 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | This typically includes:<br>- drafting documents<br>- identifying or introducing people to act in the type of role specified<br>- performing tasks to make the relevant appointments or authorisations on behalf of a client.<br>This doesn’t include persons acting in either a:<br>fiduciary capacity because of an order of a court or tribunal<br>trustee of a regulated debtor’s estate due to bankruptcy. | Criminals can exploit accountants acting on behalf of a person in several ways, including to:<br>- obscure control behind those acting on their behalf<br>- integrate illegal funds into the economy by moving the funds through additional entities to obscure the origin. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Acting as a nominee shareholder of a body corporate, or legal arrangement, on behalf of a person. This includes arranging for another person to act in these roles.<br>(Item 8 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | This typically includes:<br>- drafting or amending documents to authorise a ‘nominee shareholder’<br>- identifying or introducing a person to act as a ‘nominee shareholder’ on behalf of a nominator. | Criminals can exploit accountants acting as a nominee shareholder in several ways, including to:<br>- obscure ownership behind the nominees<br>- integrate illegal funds into the economy by moving the funds through additional entities to obscure the origin. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Providing a registered office address or principal place of business address, of a body corporate or legal arrangement.<br>(Item 9 of table 6 of the AML/CTF Act) | When a practice provides a body corporate with a registered office address or principal place of business address instead of the address the person operates their business from. | Criminals can use this service to appear legitimate and make it seem like the business is operating in a different location to where it’s located. This allows them to distance themselves from illicit activities, making it difficult to identify beneficial ownership.<br>The service can facilitate the use of complex legal structures with ties to overseas jurisdictions. This could help criminals launder illicit funds to high-risk countries for ML/TF use. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |

### Designated services: Risk factors

| Risk factor | Description of risk | Why it creates ML/TF vulnerability | Inherent risk rating | Risk appetite – would you accept this risk? | If NO, how will you avoid this risk? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High value transactions | Accountants can facilitate or assist with high-value transactions across a range of business areas, including:<br>- acquiring new companies<br>- obtaining financing<br>- purchase of property, plant and equipment.<br>They’re also involved in business cash management, investments, and financial markets. | Accountants often facilitate high value transactions on behalf of their clients, making them attractive for laundering significant amounts of illicit funds without drawing attention from law enforcement.<br>Some transactions can occur very quickly, including those in commercial matters. This speed of transactions, along with their high value, can allow criminals to move significant amounts of illicit funds in a single transaction. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Unusual physical transactions | Any physical currency transaction (for example, in A$ notes and coins or a foreign currency equivalent) that’s unusual in the circumstances.<br>Whether a physical currency transaction is unusual will often depend on:<br>- the size and complexity of the transaction<br>- if it has an apparent economic or lawful purpose<br>- if it’s consistent with what you know about the client and their industry. | Physical currency is anonymous and hard to trace, making it difficult to verify the source of funds. In Australia, it’s one of the most restrained, forfeited or frozen asset types in criminal asset confiscation matters. It’s exploited for its accessibility, widespread acceptance and availability. Its use also requires minimal skills, knowledge and expertise.<br>Criminals may give the cash directly to your practice or deposit it into your statutory trust account directly. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Unusual virtual asset transactions | Any transaction involving a virtual asset (for example, digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum).<br>Whether a virtual asset transaction is unusual will often depend on:<br>- whether the use of virtual assets is common in the circumstances<br>- if there is any apparent economic or lawful purpose for using virtual assets over fiat currency (this is government-issued currency, such as $A)<br>- if it’s consistent with what you know about the client and their industry. | Criminals are attracted to virtual assets because they:<br>- offer speed and global reach – transactions are almost instant and irreversible, making it challenging to detect and stop illicit use<br>- allow movement of value with low visibility of the identity of the individual who owns or controls it.<br>After someone exchanges fiat currency for virtual assets, their payments completely bypass oversight from financial institutions. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Effective anonymity | Accountants can help their clients create legal structures which make it hard to determine who owns or controls their property or money. This often involves creating layers of companies, trusts and other entities between the individual and the property or money they’re trying to hide.<br>Of note, there are many legitimate uses of complex legal structures. Whether this is unusual depends on if the requested services could be used for an illegitimate purpose.<br>If you can clearly identify all individuals who control and benefit from the trust, this reduces and/or removes anonymity. | Complex legal structures and arrangements are attractive to criminals as they can provide anonymity and legitimacy when seeking to obscure their activities.<br>Where a person’s ownership and control structure is highly complex or unusual, it can be very difficult to analyse each layer and identify the beneficial owners. This makes the beneficial ownership ‘effectively anonymous’.<br>Although there are legitimate reasons to use complex ownership and control structures, these structures are often used by criminals to distance themselves from transactions and activity which may attract attention from law enforcement. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Unusual service requests | Any request for designated services which:<br>- has no apparent economic or legal purpose<br>- would involve unusually complex or large transactions<br>- would involve an unusual pattern of transactions. | Clients who seek unusual services from your practices are more likely to be seeking services to disguise or facilitate ML/TF or criminal activity. Criminals often act and transact in ways which may appear illogical or uneconomical to other people.<br>For example, where a client is willing to pay significantly higher fees if the service is done quickly. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |

### Designated services: New and emerging technologies

|  | This table supports Step 1 in Part 1 of the Customise the program starter kit guide.<br>Refer to the customise guide for full instructions on completing the table. |
| --- | --- |

New and emerging technologies may affect the ML/TF risks associated with services you provide to clients and the channels you use when providing services. Some examples of technologies which may be vulnerable to exploitation by clients are provided below.

| Kind of technology | Description | Why it creates ML/TF vulnerabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Artificial intelligence (AI) | Accountants are often required to conduct a high volume of enquiries using various software programs and technological options, including artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, virtual assistants and chatbots powered by AI are also being used to engage first-time clients.<br>AI and machine learning are being adopted by practices to:<br>- enhance data analysis and decision making<br>- automate repetitive work through robotic process automation.<br>AI and machine learning can be used specifically relating to their AML/CTF processes. For example:<br>- Encrypted apps and AI work management platforms are being increasingly used by practices to deal with and communicate with their clients.<br>- Digital identity solutions can be used by practices to remotely identify and verify clients during onboarding. These solutions use AI to perform micro expression analysis, anti-spoofing checks, fake image detection, and human face attributes analysis. | Leveraging emerging technologies, criminals can hide their identities using techniques such as:<br>- impersonating phone numbers and email addresses (spoofing)<br>- using deepfake images and videos to impersonate another person through digital channels. |

### Clients: Inherent risk

| --- | --- |

| Kinds of client | Description | Vulnerabilities to ML/TF risk | Risk appetite - would you deal with these clients? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Individuals and sole traders | An individual client, other than a sole trader, is a human being with legal capacity to enter into contracts and conduct transactions.<br>A sole trader is an individual client who owns and operates a business alone, with no legal separation between the owner and the business. Like individuals, sole traders have the legal capacity to enter into contracts and conduct transactions. | The risk level varies based on personal, transactional and contextual factors.<br>Individual clients can have risk factors that increase their ML/TF risk. This includes:<br>- their personal background and occupation<br>- their business activities<br>- their source of funds<br>- their financial behaviour<br>- any potential connections to high-risk activities or jurisdictions. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Bodies corporate | A body corporate is a tyle of legal structure with a separate legal identity from their owners or members. A body corporate is recognised by law as having its own rights and obligations.<br>The most common forms of companies are:<br>- private companies (Proprietary Limited)<br>- public companies (Limited)<br>- unlisted public companies (Limited)<br>- owner’s strata corporations<br>- cooperatives<br>- incorporated partnerships | Bodies corporate may be attractive to money launderers as they're easy to set up or purchase with limited knowledge, skills or expertise. They also provide criminals with the capacity to launder high volumes of funds without the activity being directly linked to their own identity.<br>Australian authorities report that bodies corporate are often exploited alongside other types of entities to create complex and opaque legal and group structures.<br>The absence of public information about the beneficial owners of companies can make it difficult to verify if you’re indirectly engaging with a criminal entity. It often requires manual analysis and information gathering. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Partnerships | A partnership refers to where 2 or more individuals or other legal entities share ownership. A partnership isn't a separate legal entity from its owners.<br>The most common forms of partnerships are:<br>- general partnerships (simpler)<br>- limited partnerships (more complex). | The level of risk will vary based on a range of factors.<br>Partnership clients can have risk factors that increase the ML/TF risk including the:<br>- backgrounds of the partners<br>- nature of their business activities<br>- ownership and control structure<br>- geographic location of the partners<br>- source of partnership funds. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Trusts | A trust refers to a legal arrangement where one or more trustees hold and manage assets for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries.<br>A trustee may be an individual or a legal entity (such as a company).<br>The most common forms of trusts are:<br>- discretionary trusts (often used for family trusts)<br>- unit trusts (often used by investment firms)<br>- testamentary trusts (often created as part of an estate). | Trusts are attractive vehicles for money laundering as they separate the legal owner of the assets (the trustee) from the beneficiary. This helps hide the beneficiary’s interests. Trusts may also use a shell company with dummy directors as trustee to make it harder to identify who’s controlling the trust.<br>Australian authorities say trusts are frequently used with companies to form complicated, unclear legal structures.<br>Lack of transparency for trusts in Australia hinders the detection of criminal use, making it harder to identify and seize illicit assets. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Associations | An association refers to a group of individuals who come together for a common purpose without forming a corporation or similar legal entity. Unless it’s registered as an incorporated association, the association itself doesn’t have legal rights or obligations.<br>Associations may be incorporated or unincorporated. | Associations can have risk factors that increase the ML/TF risk including the:<br>- backgrounds of the members<br>- nature of the association’s activities<br>- incorporation status<br>- control and governance structure<br>- geographic location<br>- source and use of association funds.<br>Unincorporated associations don't have the legal right to own property. Other kinds of clients may sell, buy or transfer property on behalf of an unincorporated association. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Government bodies | A government body refers to a legal entity that’s established and recognised by a government to perform specific functions and duties. They have a separate legal identity from their members or employees. A government body is recognised by law as having rights and obligations. | While government entities are typically subject to strong oversight and internal controls, they can still be exploited indirectly or become vulnerable under certain conditions.<br>Government body clients can have risk factors that increase their ML/TF risk including the:<br>- nature of their activities<br>- geographic location<br>- amount of bribery and corruption present<br>- associations with high-risk jurisdictions. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |

### Clients: Risk factors

It’s important to note that the following risk factors will arise if they’re present in any person involved in the designated service, including:

- the client of the designated service
- any representative of the client
- any person on whose behalf a client is receiving a service (for example, a beneficiary of a trust)
- any beneficial owner of the client.

| Risk factor | Description of risk | Why it creates ML/TF vulnerability | Inherent risk rating | Risk appetite – would you accept this risk? | If NO, how will you avoid this risk? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Individuals that you suspect have committed profit-generating offences | An individual may be involved in crime and use criminal proceeds to buy property.<br>Not all criminal offences generate ML/TF risks. Offences that can be used to generate illicit profits include, but aren't limited to:<br>- money laundering<br>- terrorism financing<br>- fraud and other financial crimes<br>- tax evasion<br>- corruption<br>- drug trafficking<br>- people smuggling. | Criminals who have profited from serious crimes are highly likely to try and obtain professional assistance when laundering their illicit funds. They’re likely to continue doing so until their behaviour is detected. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Politically exposed persons (PEPs) (domestic) | Individuals who hold, or have held, senior roles in an Australian government body. This includes their family members and close associates, even if those people haven't held such roles themselves.<br>To establish if a former PEP may still present ML/TF risk, you should consider factors such as:<br>- if the person still has influence over government decisions<br>- the time that has elapsed since the person was a PEP<br>- if the person is still prominent and politically connected. | PEPs often have a public profile and may be vulnerable to corruption and bribery.<br>For example, they may be able to influence any of the following:<br>- government spending and budgets<br>- procurement processes<br>- development approvals and grants. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| PEPs (international organisations) | Individuals who hold, or have held, senior roles in an international organisation. This also includes their family members and close associates, even if those people haven’t held such roles themselves.<br>To establish if a former PEP may still present ML/TF risk, you should consider factors, such as:<br>- if the person still has influence over international organisation decisions<br>- the time that has elapsed since the person was a PEP<br>- if the person is still prominent and internationally connected. | PEPs often have a public profile and may be vulnerable to corruption and bribery. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| PEPs (foreign) | Individuals who hold, or have held, senior roles in a foreign country’s government. This includes their family members and close associates, even if those people haven’t held such roles themselves.<br>To establish whether a former PEP may still present ML/TF risk, you should consider factors such as:<br>- if the person still has influence over government decisions<br>- the time that has elapsed since the person was a PEP<br>- if the person is still prominent and politically connected. | PEPs often have a public profile and may be vulnerable to corruption and bribery.<br>Foreign PEPs involved in corrupt activity frequently travel outside their jurisdiction to avoid domestic law enforcement. They may seek to move illegally generated funds offshore to avoid confiscation. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Client’s legal structures creating effective anonymity | Where a person’s ownership and control structure is highly complex or unusual, it can be difficult to analyse each layer and identify the beneficial owners. This makes the beneficial ownership ‘effectively anonymous’.<br>Although there are legitimate reasons to use complex ownership and control structures, these structures are often used by criminals to distance themselves from transactions and activity which may attract attention from law enforcement.<br>Importantly, beneficial owners of legal structures aren’t effectively anonymous if you can gather reliable documents which show individuals with ownership or control. For example, although information about trusts isn't usually publicly available, getting the trust deed may show that the trustee and beneficiaries are related individuals. | Given the lack of measures to provide information about beneficial ownership of companies and trusts in Australia, the use of complex legal structures remains a major challenge for law enforcement.<br>This vulnerability is of particular concern as the use of Australian companies and financial infrastructure to evade sanctions is a key proliferation funding threat. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Third party (for individuals) | An individual acts through a third party or intermediary, such as a local representative.<br>Note: this risk doesn't apply if the third party is a reporting entity enrolled with AUSTRAC or the client is not an individual (such as a company). | Using a third party or intermediary makes it difficult to:<br>- know who the client is<br>- know what information the third party receives<br>- verify the source of funds.<br>Law enforcement confiscation of property and other assets purchased with proceeds of crime is challenging when third parties are used to conceal ownership. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Clients with significant unexplained wealth | A client has wealth far greater than their known legal income or assets and is unable to provide a reasonable explanation for the source of their wealth. | Unexplained wealth is a strong indicator of money laundering. It’s a common offence type used in money laundering prosecutions and criminal asset confiscation cases. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Charities and non-profit organisations (NPOs) | Registered charities and legitimate NPOs provide an attractive channel for terrorism financing as donations can be solicited from many individuals, witting and unwitting, and diverted for illicit purposes. Most observed cases relate to outgoing funds to support violent extremism or designated terrorist groups overseas. | As charities and non-profit organisations (NPOs) aren't reporting entities under the AML/CTF Act, detection of suspicious financial activity is therefore reliant on other reporting entities who provide services to NPOs. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Low complexity clients | A client presents with low complexity. For example, a domestic individual or a low complexity legal structure with no other underlying high-risk factors. | There’s low inherent risk associated with these parties in the absence of other risk factors. Low inherent risk does not mean no risk. | Low | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Suspected false and fraudulent identities | Criminals can use false identities to obtain services from practices without disclosing their real identity to them.<br>False identities can involve using fake identification documents, lying on documentation about personal details, or using technology to impersonate another person. | Using a false identity allow criminals to get services which may have otherwise been out of reach, avoiding detection by those practices and affecting their ability to correctly assess ML/TF risk.<br>Leveraging emerging technologies, criminals can more easily hide their identities than ever before. Using techniques such as spoofing (impersonating phone numbers and email addresses) or using deepfake images and videos, criminals can take advantage of remote and digital channels more easily than ever before.<br>You should consider how their delivery channels may allow for false identities and how you will detect if your customer and other related parties are who they claim to be. | High | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |

## Common ML/TF methods

|  | ML/TF methods refer to publicly known trends in how criminals launder money and finance terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Identifying trends and patterns in criminal behaviours will help you to:<br>- understand the nature of existing and emerging ML/TF threats<br>- detect where criminals may try to use these methods when attempting to exploit your services. |
| --- | --- |

The table below shows typical industry-specific ML/TF methods for you to look out for. Note that your practice may encounter other methods used by criminals which aren’t listed here.

Use this information as a reference during your daily monitoring and when reviewing client activity. If you aren’t sure if something is suspicious, escalate it so the AML/CTF compliance officer can make the assessment and determine next steps.

| Method | Description | How it creates ML/TF risk | Possible red flags/indicators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Misuse of client accounts (including trust accounts) | Using client accounts to transfer funds without providing an underlying designated service.<br>This can include unknown transactions made by the client or other professionals on their behalf. | Criminals can misuse trust accounts to move illicit money while hiding its origin from the beneficiary.<br>Criminal proceeds can also be commingled with legitimate client funds, making it difficult for law enforcement to detect suspicious activity. | - There is no legitimate reason why the transfer is made through your trust account, rather than their personal bank account.<br>- Uses trust account to purchase services or products that have no reasonable connection to services typically provided by your firm. |
| Misuse of bodies corporate or legal arrangements | Bodies corporate and legal arrangements can hide the ownership, purpose, activities and financing relating to criminal activity, serving as a source of income. | Makes it more challenging to monitor and perform client due diligence and verify the source of funds. | - Structure of body corporate or legal arrangements can effectively ensure anonymity of individuals who own, control or benefit from property or money.<br>- Structure is unnecessarily complex, and complexity cannot be explained by economic or legitimate reasons. |
| Use of specialised skills to use complexity to hide criminal activity | Specialised skills can be used to benefit criminal activity. The skills include the creation of company and trust formation, performing financial transactions and providing financial advice. | Skillsets held by professional service providers can be used for methods of concealing and transferring criminal funds, obscuring ownership and criminal activity.<br>The reputation and status of an accounting practice creates an air of legitimacy that can be used to obscure the illicit use of services and skills. | - Requests or uses unnecessarily complex business ownership structures, including nominee shareholders or bearer shares.<br>- Asks to buy aged shelf companies, rather than set up new ones.<br>- Requests the creation of a trust where it’s unlikely to be appropriate or necessary |
| Loan-back schemes | Used by criminals to disguise illicit funds as legitimate loans. Criminals lend themselves money, often through property purchases or shares in investment funds. The ‘loan’ makes it appear that funds come from legitimate business activity. | - Creates the appearance of lawful funds.<br>- Hides the true identity of the parties.<br>- Disguises the real purpose of the transaction.<br>- Makes it difficult to identify and verify the source of funds of a transaction and the identity of ownership. | - Client using their own company or associate to provide a loan.<br>- Funds recycled through the same accounts.<br>- Loan terms that are unusual or not at market rate.<br>- Requests contracts for private loan agreements outside the financial system, with an unclear source of funds or wealth.<br>- Is involved in business agreements or payments where the asset value is hidden or hard to determine. |
| Unnecessary use of non-financial professionals | Using professional services to create structures to move illicit funds unnoticed. This includes other professionals being used as a nominee director, shareholder or trustee, to disguise the client’s true identity or involvement. | Increases the difficulty to verify the client’s true identify and find and verify the source of funds. | - Client insists on using unnecessary, non-financial professionals without clear need.<br>- Unnecessary non-financial professionals involved in multiple complex transactions without a clear business reason. |
| Shell companies | Companies which have no real assets or any legitimate operations. They may hold a bank account and be registered as providing certain services; however, the company will rarely show any indications of a legitimate business. | Domestic and foreign shell companies commonly feature in Australian money laundering investigations. They’re used to create a layer between suspicious transactions and the criminals.<br>Shell companies often use dummy directors or shareholders on official record who have no actual involvement with the company’s activities. These individuals are used to conceal beneficial ownership and complicate the identification and disruption of money laundering. | - Company with little or no apparent business activity.<br>- Company uses dummy directors or shareholders. |
| Offshore companies and trusts | Companies and other legal entities or arrangements may be formed in one country but only ever used in others. These companies are particularly suspicious when they’re based in countries which lack oversight or allow secrecy for beneficial owners (often known as tax havens). | Using offshore companies makes it harder for reporting entities to identify where beneficial owners are located, and where funds ultimately originate from or will ultimate be received.<br>For example, where a person in a high-risk jurisdiction sends funds to an account held by a shell company in a tax haven country prior to a transfer to Australia, the Australian party would not have visibility of the true source. | - Client in Australia using an offshore company.<br>- Client is a domestic entity owned by an offshore company in a tax haven or secrecy jurisdiction. |
| Overvaluation or undervaluation | The overvaluing, undervaluing, or manipulation of the real value of an asset is a technique that consists of buying or selling assets at a price above or below its market value. This includes properties, body corporate and legal arrangements. | For undervaluation, the sale contract would record a price lower than market value. The buyer pays the difference to the seller with illicit cash.<br>For overvaluation, the asset would be purchased at an inflated price, so that the buyer can secure the largest possible loan, which can then be repaid using illicit funds. | - Asset sold well above or below market price.<br>- Repeated transaction involving related parties. |
| Structuring payments | Structuring payments to avoid reporting obligations or evade tax. Structuring can also occur using names of third parties to avoid the threshold reporting obligations. | Can be used to avoid suspicion from regulatory bodies or evade tax. | - Frequent small transactions just under threshold reporting.<br>- Use of multiple accounts (own or third party) to spread deposits. |
