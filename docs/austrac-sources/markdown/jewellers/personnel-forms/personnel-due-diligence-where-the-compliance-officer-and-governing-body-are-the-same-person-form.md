# Personnel due diligence where the compliance officer and governing body are the same person form

This form applies when an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) compliance officer also serves as the business' governing body. It outlines the due diligence requirements and how to record the appointment.

AUSTRAC considers it sufficient for the individual to attest to their own suitability, supported by relevant information, as they:

- serve both as the business’ governing body (and would therefore be liable if an unsuitable person held these roles)
- are fully aware of their own circumstances.

Follow the instructions in each section carefully.
