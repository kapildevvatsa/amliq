# Risk

| This is Part 1 of 4 of Customise the jeweller program starter kit. |
| :--- |

You’ll be customising this risk assessment in this part. This covers:

- completing the risk assessment
- determining your risk appetite
- risk rating countries you deal with.

### Why it matters

You must keep a current and accurate money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing risk assessment for your business. We refer to this as ML/TF risk.

This assessment helps you identify where your business is most exposed to ML/TF activity, so you can focus your resources where they’re needed most.

### Overview of the process

- Step 1: Review your services and customers.
- Step 2: Determine your risk appetite.
- Step 3: Risk rate countries you deal with.

### What you’ll achieve

- By the end of this part, you’ll have a completed ML/TF risk assessment customised to your business.

### Learn more

|  | Read our [Risk assessment guidance](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/develop-your-amlctf-program-reform/step-2-identify-and-assess-your-risks-risk-assessment-reform) to understand your obligations. |
| :--- | :--- |

## Step 1: Review your services and customers

We’ve prepared a risk assessment based on typical services, delivery methods and kinds of customers in your industry. However, your business might not deal with everything we’ve included.

This step helps you identify:

- which designated services you provide
- how you deliver your services
- which kinds of customers you provide services to
- new or emerging technologies you use or deal with.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Review the Inherent risk tables for designated services, customers and delivery channels in the Risk assessment. Consider if each risk is applicable to your business.<br>You might decide a row isn’t applicable because you won't:<br>  - provide a service covered<br>  - provide services to a kind of customer listed<br>  - use a delivery channel or technology listed.<br>  - The customer row has been pre-filled to only include customers who are individuals. Your peak bodies requested this on the basis that you:<br>  - are unlikely to accept large physical currency transactions from body corporates or legal arrangements<br>  - can accept alternative methods of payment, such as via bank transfer. | [Risk assessment](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Risk assessment):<br>- Designated services: Inherent risks<br>- Customers: Inherent risks<br>- Delivery channels: Inherent risks |
| - Record your decision by selecting YES or NO in the Risk appetite column.<br>Consider if you could see these risks through occasional or one-off scenarios. If in doubt, select YES – you can always update your selections later if they change. |  |
| - Review the New and emerging technologies table.<br>Consider whether your business uses or deals with any new or emerging technologies when providing services and add these to the tables (for example, your systems use artificial intelligence). | [Risk assessment](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Risk assessment):<br>- Designated services: New and emerging technologies |

### Example – Updating services and customers

A jewellery business only deals with customers who are individuals or sole traders. They complete physical currency transactions for precious metals, metals, stones and products worth $10,000 or more. We refer to these as ‘regulated transactions’. They offer these services in person, through their storefront.

The jewellery business reviews the Risk assessment and makes the following changes:

- Designated services – selects YES for completing one or multiple linked physical currency transactions for precious metals, stones and products worth $10,000 or more
- New and emerging technologies – keeps the references to artificial intelligence and new jewellery technologies
- Kinds of customers – selects YES for ‘individuals and sole traders’, and NO for all other kinds of customers (as pre-selected in the risk assessment)
- Delivery channels – selects YES for ‘in person’, and NO for the rest of the delivery channels.

## Step 2: Review risk factors to determine your risk appetite

This step helps you decide the level of ML/TF risk your business is prepared to accept when providing designated services.

You might decide not to deal with customers who are high risk and require more thorough checks.

This step covers:

- assessing the risk factors identified in the risk assessment
- documenting whether you’re willing to deal with the risk.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| Review the Risk factors tables for designated services, customers and delivery channels in the Risk assessment. | [Risk assessment](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Risk assessment):<br>- Designated services: Risk factors<br>- Customers: Risk factors<br>- Delivery channels: Risk factors<br>Risk factors describe specific situations or characteristics that may increase ML/TF risks, such as:<br>- transaction types<br>- customer behaviours<br>- delivery channels. |
| - For each risk factor decide if you’re willing to accept the risk as part of your business operations.<br>Record your decision by selecting YES or NO in the Risk appetite column. | To determine your risk appetite, consider the size of your business, the services you provide, the customers you deal with and your ability to apply controls.<br>Your risk appetite should be realistic and capable of being applied consistently in practice. |
| - If you select NO for a risk factor, you must apply controls to reduce or avoid exposure to that risk.<br>Record these controls in the If NO, how will you avoid this risk? column. | For example, if completing regulated transactions for high-risk customers is outside your risk appetite, you may ask the customer to deposit the cash into their personal bank account then make the payment from that account. |

### Example – Determining risk appetite and controls

The jewellery business decides they don’t want to perform regulated transactions involving high-risk factors or with high-risk customers. To avoid this, they implement a control of asking any high-risk customer to deposit the physical currency into their personal bank account then make the payment from this account.

They complete the risk assessment as follows:

| Risk factor | Description of risk | Inherent risk rating | Risk appetite | If NO, how will you avoid this risk? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High value physical currency transactions | Precious metals, stones, and products purchased using high value physical currency transaction(s) (for example, in Australian dollar notes and coins or a foreign currency equivalent) valued at $50,000 or more. | High | NO | We’ll ask the customer to make the payment via bank transfer. If they don't comply, we'll offboard the customer. |

## Step 3: Risk rate countries you deal with

If you deal with countries other than Australia when providing designated services, you must assign a risk rating and decide if each country is within your risk appetite. This step covers how to assign a country risk rating.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| - In the Countries: risk assessment table, list every country your business deals with when providing a designated service. This includes countries that:<br>  - your customer is a resident of or located in when receiving a designated service (if they’re an individual)<br>  - your customer was created in (if they’re a body corporate or legal arrangement such as a trust)<br>  - representatives, persons receiving the service on behalf of the customer and beneficial owners are residents of or located. | [Risk assessment](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Risk assessment):<br>- Countries: Risk assessment |
| - Enter the Basel AML Index rating.<br>  - Go to the [Basel AML Index website](https://index.baselgovernance.org/ranking).<br>  - Find the score for each country in your list.<br>  - Assign a risk rating using the scores to the right.<br>  - Enter the rating in the Basel AML risk rating column. | Basel score risk rating:<br>- 0.00-5.00 - Low risk<br>- 5.01-6.00 - Medium risk<br>- 6.01-10.00 - High risk |
| - For each country listed in Action 1, check if it appears on the FATF list of high-risk jurisdictions or the DFAT sanctions list.<br>Record YES or NO in the Listed in high-risk country list column. | Websites:<br>- [FATF high-risk jurisdictions](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions.html)<br>- [DFAT sanctions list](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/consolidated-list) |
| - Assign the final country risk rating.<br>  - If you recorded YES in the Listed in high-risk country list column, assign a high-risk rating. This overrides the Basel rating.<br>  - If you recorded NO, use the Basel rating entered in Action 2.<br>  - If the country doesn't appear on the Basel Index, FATF or DFAT list, then reach a rating by referring to the materials in the Basel Index methodology. | Websites:<br>- [Basel AML Index methodology](https://index.baselgovernance.org/methodology) |
| - Determine if you’re willing to accept each country risk by recording YES or NO in the Risk appetite – would you deal with these customers? column.<br>- For any country you’ve selected NO, you must apply controls to reduce or avoid exposure to that risk. Record these controls in the If NO, how will you avoid this risk? column. |  |

### Example

A small jewellery business checks the residential addresses of their customers on 16 January 2026. They identify 2 countries other than Australia, and complete the country risk table of the risk assessment as follows:

| Country | Basel AML risk rating | Listed in high-risk country list | Final country risk rating | Risk appetite – would you deal with these customers? | If NO, how will you avoid this risk? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Australia | Low | No | Low | YES |  |
| Japan | Medium | No | Medium | YES |  |
| France | Low | No | Low | YES |  |

# Personnel

| This is Part 2 of 4 of Customise your jeweller program starter kit. Complete Part 1: Risk before starting. |
| :--- |

This part covers:

- identifying roles that perform AML/CTF duties
- conducting personnel due diligence (PDD)
- planning initial personnel training.

### Why it matters

You must conduct due diligence on personnel and provide training to anyone performing AML/CTF roles. Your personnel are the frontline in preventing exploitation and protecting your business from ML/TF risks. These measures ensure they’re suitable, reliable and capable of meeting their obligations.

### Overview of the process

There are 6 steps to follow.

- [Step 1: Identify AML/CTF-related roles.](#step-1-identify-all-amlctf-related-roles)
- [Step 2: Collect and verify information.](#step-2-collect-and-verify-information)
- [Step 3: Assess suitability.](#step-3-assess-suitability)
- [Step 4: Appoint and record the outcome.](#step-4-appoint-and-record-the-outcome)
- [Step 5: Plan your ongoing PDD process.](#step-5-implement-ongoing-pdd)
- [Step 6: Plan initial personnel training.](#step-6-plan-initial-personnel-training)

### What you’ll achieve

By the end of this part, you’ll have:

- a completed record of AML/CTF-related roles and assigned personnel
- documented PDD records
- a plan for conducting ongoing PDD when implementing your program
- a plan for delivering initial personnel training.

### Learn more

|  | Read our guidance to understand your obligations:<br>  - [Establishing your governance framework](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/develop-your-amlctf-program-reform/step-1-establish-your-governance-framework-reform)<br>  - [Personnel due diligence and training](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/personnel-due-diligence-and-training-reform/personnel-due-diligence-reform) |
| :--- | :--- |

## Step 1: Identify all AML/CTF-related roles

This step identifies:

- your AML/CTF governance roles – AML/CTF compliance officer, senior manager and governing body
- roles that have AML/CTF duties, such as customer due diligence (CDD), suspicious activity reporting (SMR) and compliance oversight.

### How to complete this step

## Step 2: Collect and verify information

This step covers gathering the required documents and conducting screening to assess personnel.

If the person is in an AML/CTF role you need to collect information until you are satisfied of their integrity, competence and independence.

For the AML/CTF compliance officer role, you must also carry out a national criminal history check on this person.

You don’t need to complete this step if you’re assessing yourself and are any of the following:

1. a single employee business
2. both the AML/CTF compliance officer and governing body of your business.

### How to complete this step

### Good to know

|  | Integrate your existing workflows<br>Your business may already have personnel files, forms and processes for appointing roles. You don’t need to duplicate these or create separate documents for AML/CTF purposes.<br>Consider integrating the AML/CTF requirements from the starter kit forms into your existing documents and processes. This helps align AML/CTF requirements with workflows your staff already use. |
| :--- | :--- |

## Step 3: Assess suitability

This step covers how to assess if personnel are suitable for an AML/CTF role using the information collected in Step 2.

If you’re a single employee business, or both the AML/CTF compliance officer and governing body, you’ll complete a different form to assess your own suitability.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| - For a single employee business, or an AML/CTF compliance officer who is also in the governing body role:<br>Complete Steps 1 to 3 of the Personnel due diligence where AML/CTF compliance officer and governing body are the same person form.<br>- For other AML/CTF compliance officer roles:<br>Complete Steps 4, 5 and 6 of the Personnel due diligence for AML/CTF compliance officer form.<br>- For all other AML/CTF-related roles:<br>Complete Steps 4 and 5 of the Personnel due diligence form. | [Personnel forms](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Personnel forms):<br>- Personnel due diligence form<br>- Personnel due diligence for AML/CTF compliance officer form<br>- Personnel due diligence where AML/CTF compliance officer and governing body are the same person form |

## Step 4: Appoint and record the outcome

This step covers appointing personnel to AML/CTF-related roles and record keeping.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |

| - For a single employee business, or an AML/CTF compliance officer who is also in the governing body role:<br>Complete Step 4 of the Personnel due diligence for where the AML/CTF compliance officer is also the governing body form.<br>Complete Step 5 to record when you notify AUSTRAC, which you must do within 14 days.<br>- Otherwise for the AML/CTF compliance officer role:<br>Complete Step 7 of the Personnel due diligence for AML/CTF compliance officer form.<br>Complete Step 8 to record when you notify AUSTRAC, which you must do within 14 days.<br>- For all other AML/CTF-related roles:<br>Complete Step 6 of the Personnel due diligence form. | [Personnel forms](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Personnel forms):<br>- Personnel due diligence form<br>- Personnel due diligence for AML/CTF compliance officer form<br>- Personnel due diligence for where the AML/CTF compliance officer is also the governing body form<br>Guidance:<br>- [Record keeping](https://www.austrac.gov.au/about-us/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/develop-your-amlctf-program-reform/record-keeping-reform) |

### Good to know

|  | Quick summary: Record keeping<br>Personnel due diligence records are records of your AML/CTF program. You must keep them for 7 years after they’re no longer relevant to show you’re meeting your obligations.<br>For example, if you appoint person A as your AML/CTF compliance officer in March 2026 and they leave the role in July 2028, their PDD records stop being relevant at the time they leave. This is when the 7-year retention period begins. |
| :--- | :--- |

## Step 5: Implement ongoing PDD

Ongoing PDD requires you to reassess the suitability of a person for a role as soon as practicable if you identify circumstances that may impact their suitability. This includes circumstances that may affect their:

- integrity – statutory declaration and any self-reported changes
- competence – performance reviews, training outcomes and observed conduct.

All personnel with AML/CTF roles must self-report any circumstances that may impact their suitability to the business as soon as practicable. If a person is no longer suitable, you must take appropriate action as outlined under your policy.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Refer to the Personnel due diligence policy to understand the steps required for ongoing PDD. | [Policy document](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Policy document):<br>- Personnel due diligence<br>Guidance:<br>- [Ongoing personnel due diligence](https://www.austrac.gov.au/about-us/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/personnel-due-diligence-and-training-reform/personnel-due-diligence-reform#How%20to%20conduct%20personnel%20due%20diligence:~:text=CTF%20compliance%20officer.-,Ongoing%20personnel%20due%20diligence,-This%20section%20refers) |
| - For a single employee business, or an AML/CTF compliance officer who is also in the governing body role:<br>Complete Step 7 of the Personnel due diligence for where the AML/CTF compliance officer is also the governing body form to record any action taken under ongoing PDD.<br>- Otherwise for the AML/CTF compliance officer role:<br>Complete Step 9 of the Personnel due diligence for AML/CTF compliance officer form to record any action taken under ongoing PDD.<br>- For all other AML/CTF-related roles:<br>Complete Step 7 of the Personnel due diligence form to record any action taken under ongoing PDD. | [Personnel forms](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Personnel forms):<br>- Personnel due diligence form<br>- Personnel due diligence for AML/CTF compliance officer form<br>- Personnel due diligence for where the AML/CTF compliance officer is also the governing body form |

## Step 6: Plan initial personnel training

Personnel training ensures staff in AML/CTF-related roles understand their responsibilities and can apply them.

This step covers how to:

- decide your training approach
- understand the training content required for each role
- set up processes you’ll use when delivering training.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Review the Personnel training policy to understand how you will train each AML/CTF role. | [Policy document](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Policy document):<br>- Personnel training<br>Guidance:<br>- [AML/CTF training](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/personnel-due-diligence-and-training-reform/amlctf-training-reform) |
| - Decide and document how you’ll deliver initial personnel training, including:<br>  - what delivery methods you’ll use<br>  - how you’ll incorporate scenario-based learning<br>  - how you’ll assess if personnel understand the material<br>  - how you’ll track and record training completion, assessment results and refresher training dates.<br>Document your plan using your own approach. | [Policy document](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Policy document):<br>- Personnel training<br>Guidance:<br>- [AML/CTF training](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/personnel-due-diligence-and-training-reform/amlctf-training-reform) |

# Customers

| This is Part 3 of 4 of Customise the jeweller program starter kit. Complete Part 2: Personnel before starting. |
| :--- |

This part covers:

reviewing customer due diligence (CDD) processes for different kinds of customers

updating the CDD policies

establishing your systems to offboard customers and avoid tipping them off if you've reported them to AUSTRAC.

### Why it matters

You must identify and verify your customers by conducting CDD before you provide a designated service. This helps you identify ML/TF risks early and determine the controls you need to protect your business from ML/TF.

### Overview of the process

Step 1: Review the sanctions and politically exposed persons (PEP) check processes.

Step 2: Review the processes for high-risk and complex customers.

Step 3: Review offboarding and tipping off controls.

Step 4: Review and update your CDD forms.

Step 5: Review and update your CDD policies.

### What you’ll achieve

By the end of this part, you’ll have a CDD process that:

identifies the ML/TF risk of your customers (low, medium, high)

manages and mitigates these risks to protect your business

identifies when you need to report suspicious behaviours to AUSTRAC

helps your staff avoid tipping off a customer.

### Learn more

| :--- | :--- |

## Step 1: Review the sanctions and politically exposed persons (PEP) check processes

You must complete a sanctions and PEP check for all customers receiving a designated service and any representatives of these customers.

This step covers:

- reviewing the sanctions and PEP screening process
- updating your CDD policy with any changes to the processes.

### How to complete this step

### Good to know

|  | Outsourcing<br>Some businesses choose to outsource this screening to external providers. If you choose to outsource these checks, you remain responsible for ensuring any outsourcing meets your AML/CTF obligations. You must also document these arrangements in your CDD policy.<br>Learn more about [using outsourcing to help meet your AML/CTF obligations.](https://www.austrac.gov.au/about-us/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/other-guidance/using-outsourcing-help-meet-your-amlctf-obligations-reform) |
| :--- | :--- |

## Step 2: Review processes for high-risk customers

If your risk appetite statement accepts high-risk customers, you must complete additional process under enhanced customer due diligence (CDD). These processes include:

- adverse media checks
- source of funds and source of wealth checks
- nature and purpose of business relationship checks
- senior manager approval processes.

If your risk appetite statement rejects high-risk customers, you do not need to follow the above processes, including those relating to enhanced CDD.

This step covers reviewing these processes and ensuring they’re appropriate for your business.

### How to complete this step

| - If you adapt this process or use a different approach, note what you have changed. You’ll need to update your CDD policies to reflect these changes at Step 5. | Step 5 – [Update your CDD policies](#step-5-implement-ongoing-pdd) |

## Step 3: Review offboarding and tipping off controls

Offboarding and tipping off controls work together, allowing you to end relationships with high-risk customers without alerting them to AML/CTF concerns or suspicious matter reporting (tipping off).

Your risk appetite in your risk assessment establishes when you’ll exit a customer. The offboarding policy outlines how to do it, and the tipping off controls guide what you say during the exit.

This step covers how to establish your offboarding process using these documents.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Review the Offboarding policy to confirm it reflects how offboarding would realistically occur in your business. | [Policy document](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Policy document):<br>- Offboarding |
| - Review the Tipping off policy. | [Policy document](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Policy document):<br>- Tipping off<br>Guidance:<br>- [Tipping off](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/current-reporting-entities/tipping) |
| - If you adapt this process or use a different approach, note what you’ve changed. You will update these policies at Step 5. | Step 5 – [Update your CDD policies](#step-5-implement-ongoing-pdd) |
| - Decide whether you’ll rely on contractual or standard terms to enforce offboarding. | Many businesses rely on standard store policies to support offboarding. For example, policy terms may allow the business to end the relationship where the customer is outside its risk appetite or doesn’t cooperate with AML/CTF requests. |
| - Update your standard agreements or terms if required. This document will be approved in Part 4. | If you rely on contractual terms to enforce offboarding, update your standard sales agreements to reflect this approach. This allows you to exit the relationship using ordinary commercial reasons. |

## Step 4: Review and update your CDD forms

Our form library includes initial customer due diligence (CDD) forms for individual and sole traders. You can use these forms to conduct CDD, after you update them to include any changes to:

- your risk assessment
- the processes you reviewed in Steps 1 to 3.

If your business prefers to keep using its own forms or systems, you can integrate the required information into those instead.

This step covers how to update the CDD forms to align with your risk assessment.

### How to complete this step

| Action | Guidance and tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Download the Onboarding forms and Initial CDD forms for individual and sole traders. | [Customer forms](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Customer forms):<br>- Onboarding forms<br>- Initial CDD forms<br>[Risk assessment](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Risk assessment):<br>- Customers: Inherent risks |
| - Decide how you’ll capture CDD information, either by:<br>  - customising the CDD forms provided<br>  - integrating the required fields into your existing onboarding workflows. | Your business may already collect most of this information during onboarding. You don’t need to duplicate documents for AML/CTF purposes.<br>Consider integrating the AML/CTF requirements from the forms into your existing onboarding documents and processes, so they align with workflows your staff already use. |
| - If your risk assessment identifies any medium or high-risk countries, add those countries to Section A1 of each relevant form, or to the corresponding section of your existing workflows. | [Customer forms](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Customer forms):<br>- Initial CDD forms<br>[Risk assessment](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1469#Risk assessment):<br>- Countries: Risk assessment |

## Step 5: Update your CDD policies and processes

This step covers updating the CDD policies with changes made in Steps 1 to 4.

Where you have adopted a different process or form or incorporated a process or form into your existing systems, update your process and policy documents.

### How to complete this step

Use the table below to update the policy and process documents to describe any systems you will use, and how you will use them, to screen your customers as decided in Part 3:

### Example

A small jewellery business reviews the processes to screen customers in the starter kit.

They instead decide to adopt a digital PEP check process that meets, and exceeds, the steps set out in the PEP check process. This speeds up their customer intake process.

They also review the fields in the CDD forms. They determine that their existing digital systems used to identify customers already addresses half of these fields. Instead of using these CDD forms directly, they decide to uplift their existing digital systems to capture the information they require. This allows them to leverage what they already do.

The business updates their:

1. Policy document – to note the use of the digital PEP check process and how will exceed the standards set by the PEP check in the process document. They also describe how their existing digital systems will capture the customer information required under the CDD forms.
2. Process document – to outline to staff how they will use the digital PEP check process and how they use their existing digital systems to capture the information required under the CDD forms and associated policies.

# Document and approve

| This is Part 4 of 4 of Customise the jeweller program starter kit. Complete Part 3: Customers before starting. |
| :--- |

In this part, you’ll collect, review and get approval for the documents that form your customised AML/CTF program. Approval at this stage confirms that your documents are suitable to start with. It doesn't mean they're finalised or will never change. Some documents may only make sense once you need to use them.

This part covers:

- gathering your customised policies, processes and forms
- ensuring any customised processes are reflected in the related policy
- obtaining senior manager approval for your program
- starting to implement your approved program.

### Why it matters

Before you provide designated services, you must have an AML/CTF program that’s:

- documented
- approved by your senior manager
- implemented into your business.

Approved and customised documents provide clarity for staff and demonstrate compliance with your obligations. They also give you a reliable foundation to build systems and controls that operate consistently in practice.

### Overview of the process

- Step 1: Have a senior manager approve your customised documents.
- Step 2: Incorporate the approved documents into your systems.

### What you’ll achieve

By the end of this part, you’ll have a:

- risk assessment, policies, processes and forms that align and reflect how your business operates
- fully documented and approved AML/CTF program
- clear foundation to implement your program.

## Step 1: Senior manager approval

Before your AML/CTF program can be implemented, it must be reviewed and approved by a senior manager.

This step confirms the program:

- reflects how the business will operate in practice
- meets the business’s AML/CTF obligations.

### How to complete this step

1. Submit your customised AML/CTF program for approval

Provide your senior manager with your:

   - customised risk assessment
   - policy document
   - process document
   - relevant forms.
2. Senior manager review

The senior manager must review the program to confirm:

   - the documents accurately reflect how the business will operate in practice
   - any customisations made to the starter kit are consistent across all documents
   - the program meets the business’s AML/CTF obligations.
3. Document approval

Each document must record the senior manager’s:

   - name
   - role
   - date of approval
   - signature (or equivalent written approval).

Approval should be documented directly on each document or in a clearly linked approval record.

4. Address any non-approval

If the senior manager doesn't approve a document, they must return it to the person who customised the program with a written response that must explain:

   - the reasons for non-approval
   - any changes the senior manager considers necessary to address the issues identified.

The document must be updated and resubmitted for approval once the issues are addressed.

5. Notify the governing body

Advise your governing body once the program has been approved (if you’re not a single-employee business).

## Step 2: Begin implementation

Once your AML/CTF program has been approved, you must put it into operation across your business. This means making sure the right people have the right documents, systems are set up correctly, and any changes made during implementation are properly controlled.

This step covers:

- distributing your AML/CTF program documents to your staff
- incorporating the completed AML/CTF program documents into your systems.

### How to complete this step

1. Distribute the approved risk assessment and policy document
- Provide documents to your governing body, and all other personnel in AML/CTF roles.
- Ensure recipients understand how these documents apply to their role and when they must follow in practice.
2. Implement your forms

Forms support day-to-day AML/CTF activities and must be accessible and usable by relevant personnel.

For each form in the program:

- If the starter kit form will be used directly, distribute it to personnel who will use it in their AML/CTF-related role.
- If the information will be captured through existing systems (for example, onboarding or transaction systems), update those systems to capture all required information.
- Train relevant personnel on how to complete the form or use updated systems correctly.
3. Implement your processes
- Give personnel with relevant AML/CTF-related roles access to the process document or the system that implements each process.
- Ensure personnel understand when to follow the process and how it fits into day-to-day work.
- Where a system or third-party service is used to carry out a process, ensure it meets or exceeds the steps set out in the starter kit process.
4. Handle changes during implementation

Implementation may identify gaps or practical issues that require changes.

- If any material changes are made to the risk assessment, policy document, processes or forms during implementation, update the relevant document to reflect the change.
- Ensure all changes are reviewed and approved by your senior manager within 14 days.
- Redistribute updated documents and provide additional training where required.

### Next step

- Go to [Step 2: Use your program](https://www.austrac.gov.au/node/1499) to learn how the program you’ve developed works and how to use it in your day-to-day business operations.

| The program starter kits are intended to be used as a complete package and have been designed for use by those reporting entities who satisfy certain suitability criteria. That suitability criteria is set out in the ‘Getting Started’ web page under the heading “Who the starter kit is for” in each program starter kit. In particular, those Tranche 2 entities who, from 1 July 2026, are for the first time subject to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing legislation (AML/CTF).<br>The program starter kits have been designed for the purpose of providing practical guidance to those reporting entities to assist them to build their own AML/CTF programs. The program starter kits represent AUSTRAC’s interpretation and application of the law to the eligible reporting entities only and are not intended to represent an interpretation and application of the law in all circumstances.<br>The program starter kits are not a substitute for legal advice about any reporting entity’s AML/CTF compliance obligations. Australian courts are ultimately responsible for interpreting the AML/CTF Legislation and determining if any provision of these laws are contravened. |
