## About this document

This document details the processes and standard operating procedures (SOPs) your business needs to meet your anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) obligations when using the AML/CTF program starter kit. These processes and SOPs will enable your business and your personnel to consistently apply AML/CTF processes. The SOPs also set out when to complete relevant forms.

It applies to all designated services your business provides in Australia, even if your customer is overseas.

This document supports and aligns with the Policy document.

## Determine if a transaction is regulated process

This process helps you to determine whether a transaction with a customer is regulated. If you are still unsure whether a transaction is regulated, read [AUSTRAC's guidance](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/before-you-start/new-industries-and-services-be-regulated-reform/precious-metals-stones-and-products-services-reform).

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Check if the items you will buy or sell are regulated items<br>The buying and selling of items may be regulated if they are precious stones, precious metals or precious products (which we call regulated items).<br>Precious metals include gold, silver, platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium or an alloy with at least 2% weight of any of these substances.<br>Precious stones are substances of gem quality with market-recognised beauty, rarity and value, including (but not limited to) beryl, corundum, diamond, garnet, jadeite jade, opal, pearl or topaz.<br>Precious products are items made of, containing, or having attached to it, any precious metals or stones (or both), that are any of the following: jewellery, watches and other items of personal adornment, along with any article of goldsmith’s or silversmith’s wares.<br>Examples include:<br>- rings crafted from gold and pearl<br>- stainless-steel watches with diamonds set on the face<br>- headdresses made of platinum and garnet<br>- gold or diamond grills (dental jewellery)<br>- belts or hair clips containing or attaching any precious metal or stone. |
|  | Does the sale or purchase involve regulated items?<br>- If YES – proceed to Step 3<br>- If NO – this is not a regulated transaction |
|  | Review the value of physical currency used to buy or sell regulated items<br>Determine the value of physical currency (eg. bank notes and coins) used to buy or sell regulated items, disregarding the value of physical currency used on non-regulated items.<br>For example:<br>- You sell $11,500 of items to a customer for physical currency. The sale involves a belt buckle with precious stones for $8,500 (regulated item) and leather shoes without precious metals or stones worth $3,000 (not a regulated item). This means that the total value of items which may be regulated items is $8,500. |
|  | Is the value of physical currency used to buy or sell regulated items $10,000 or more?<br>- If YES – this is a regulated transaction, check linked transactions under Step 5<br>- If NO – this may not be a regulated transaction, check linked transactions under Step 5 to confirm |
|  | Review the value of linked transactions<br>Review your transaction history with the customer to determine the collective value of physical currency used to buy or sell regulated items in Step 2, along with any transactions that are linked or appear to be linked.<br>Transactions that are linked, or appear to be linked, include:<br>- multiple transactions linked by invoice, payment or date of sale – multiple payments made under a single invoice, a single payment made for multiple invoices or payment made on the same date<br>- lay-by payments or other payments made through instalments.<br>If you identify a customer who appears to be splitting transactions into smaller payments to avoid a $10,000 transaction, they may be structuring to avoid reporting to AUSTRAC. This is an offence. Learn more about [structuring](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/core-guidance/reporting/transactions-10000-or-more-ttrs/reporting-structuring).<br>This may happen, for example, if they are requesting multiple invoices or payments for a purchase or sale where there is no apparent economic reason to do so. This is a crime and must be reported in a suspicious matter report. |
|  | Is the collective value of the physical currency used to purchase or sell regulated items, along with any transactions that are linked or appear to be linked, $10,000 or above?<br>- If YES – these transactions are regulated<br>- If NO – these transactions are not regulated |

## Streamlined customer due diligence for low or medium ML/TF risk individual customers process (using physical currency)

Use this process to deal with customers if your business has decided under its risk assessment that it will only accept regulated transactions for individual customers who both:

- pose a low or medium ML/TF risk
- do not activate suspicious matter reporting (SMR) obligations.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | When a customer requests the use of physical currency in their purchase or sale, refer the sale to the store manager. |
|  | Use the Determine if a transaction is regulated process above to assess whether this is a regulated transaction.<br>If YES – proceed to step 2<br>If NO – no further steps are required |
|  | Provide the customer with the Onboarding form – individual and ask them to provide the required identification documents. |
|  | Complete the Individual customer due diligence form to determine if the ML/TF risk of the customer is low, medium, or high.<br>- If the ML/TF risk is high – do not go ahead with this simplified process and instead ask the customer to make the transaction via an alternative means, such as via bank transaction. If they don’t do this, don’t take on the customer.<br>- If the ML/TF risk is low or medium – complete the rest of the individual customer due diligence form. |
|  | Confirm if there is a suspicious matter reporting obligation by referring to your AML/CTF policies and indicators of suspicious activity in the Risk assessment<br>Determine if there are reasonable grounds for a suspicion and you need to submit a suspicious matter report (SMR).<br>- If YES – don’t engage in the transaction and submit an SMR report. You could ask the customer to pay via other means but be careful you are not assisting in criminal conduct.<br>- If NO – proceed to Step 6. |
|  | Finalise the sale or purchase, and submit a threshold transaction report (TTR) if the sale or purchase involves a single transaction using physical currency valued at $10,000 or more<br>Keep records in line with your AML/CTF policies. |

## Customer risk rating and ongoing customer due diligence process

This process details how to apply an ML/TF risk rating to a customer when filling out an Initial customer due diligence form. It also includes how to review their risk rating during your business relationship with the customer.

The process also sets out how to tailor your ongoing customer due diligence (CDD) in line with the ML/TF risk rating, including the level of appropriate ongoing monitoring.

### Applying an ML/TF risk rating

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Start by assessing if any of the medium or high risk factors in the Initial customer due diligence form apply to the customer.<br>You can do this by referring to:<br>- information the customer provided in the onboarding form or through any other means (for example, as part of enhanced CDD)<br>- other information collected about the customer when performing any other processes during initial or ongoing CDD (for example, documents provided by the customer, online searches)<br>- the ML/TF risk factors, methods and indicators listed in the Risk assessment<br>- any other information you’re aware of about the customer, such as observations about interactions with the customer or their representatives.<br>- For any risk factors you believe may apply to the customer, select YES in the relevant box. |
|  | Follow the instructions in Section A2 of the Initial customer due diligence form to select the appropriate risk rating for the customer based on the boxes you marked in the risk factor table above.<br>You’ll need to add up the number of medium and high risk factors where you selected YES. Additionally, you can select a risk rating based on other information you’ve collected which may warrant that rating.<br>For example, where a customer’s behaviour matches one of the indicators of unusual or criminal behaviour in the Risk assessment but doesn't align with any of the risk factors in the form. |
|  | Detail how you determined the customer’s risk rating in the box in Section A2<br>For example, what information did you use to pick the risk rating? For a customer who is a politically exposed person (PEP), what position do they hold? |

### Applying risk-based ongoing CDD

As part of your ongoing CDD obligations, you must monitor your customer from your first interaction with them until the end of your business relationship. The table below shows the steps you should take throughout business relationships with your customers.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Monitor the customer’s behaviours during interactions with you and monitor how the customer uses your services throughout the business relationship.<br>Monitor for the following types of activity, any:<br>- unusual transactions and behaviours (refer to the indicators of unusual or criminal behaviour in the Risk assessment)<br>- transactions, behaviours or changes in their customer profile which may indicate significant changes in the customer’s risk rating (for example, the customer requests something which triggers a medium- or high-risk factor where you had previously selected NO, or where one of those risk factors no longer applies)<br>- transactions involving $10,000 or more in physical currency as part of providing a designated service (for example, a customer asks you to provide the proceeds of a $50,000 sale in cash)<br>- cross-border movement of physical currency or bearer negotiable instruments (or a combination) valued at $10,000 or more as part of providing a designated service. |
|  | Where any of the activities above occur, use the Escalation triggers and actions process to work out if you need to complete an Escalation form and provide this to the AML/CTF compliance officer. |
|  | In addition to ongoing monitoring, review the following on a periodic basis to see if it's accurate and relevant to the customer:<br>- information you collected about the customer during initial and ongoing CDD (for example, where your customer is located, the reason your customer is using your services, their occupation or business activities)<br>- the risk rating you applied to the customer (based on if any of the activities in Step 1 occur)<br>Note: you don't need to perform periodic reviews on customers after your business relationship with them has ended. |
|  | Where any of the activities in the steps above show that the customer’s risk rating may no longer be accurate or relevant, use the steps under ‘1. Applying an ML/TF risk rating’ to determine the customer’s current risk rating.<br>If there’s been a change in the customer’s information or their risk rating, update this either within the customer’s Onboarding form and Initial CDD form or in any other system where you store this information.<br>Note: a change in risk rating may require you to undertake enhanced CDD and request further information from the customer. Any further information should be gathered with respect to the Tipping off policy. |

The required level of ongoing monitoring and frequency of periodic reviews changes depending on the customer’s risk rating. The difference between each level of risk is in the table below.

| Risk level | Actions during ongoing CDD |
| :--- | :--- |
| Low | Monitor the customer’s behaviours and transactions to detect any unusual activity throughout the business relationship.<br>If the business relationship lasts longer than 3 years, conduct periodic reviews of information you hold on your customer every 3 years (starting from the date you completed initial CDD). |
| Medium | Exercise a higher level of monitoring over the customer’s behaviours and transactions than you would for low-risk customers.<br>If the business relationship lasts longer than 2 years, conduct periodic reviews of information you hold on your customer every 2 years (starting from the date you completed initial CDD). |
| High | Exercise a higher level of monitoring over the customer’s behaviours and transactions than you would for medium-risk customers.<br>If the business relationship lasts longer than one year, conduct periodic reviews of information you hold on your customer every year (starting from the date you completed initial CDD). |

## Statutory declaration process

This process details how to complete a statutory declaration for personnel who will perform AML/CTF functions, declaring any circumstances that may affect their suitability for the role.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Provide written information to the person that sets out what they must declare.<br>This includes if they:<br>- have been convicted of a serious offence (excluding spent or expunged convictions)<br>- had any other adverse findings against them that may be relevant to their integrity or capability to perform the role (for example dismissed by a previous employer)<br>- have a conflict of interest and, if they do, what they’ll do to manage this conflict of interest<br>- are willing and able to discharge the duties provided in the role description. |
|  | Ask the person to complete the statutory declaration using the information you provided.<br>The person can complete either a [Commonwealth statutory declaration](https://www.ag.gov.au/legal-system/publications/commonwealth-statutory-declaration-form) or a statutory declaration from the state or territory in which they reside. These documents are available online and come with instructions for how they must be filled out. |
|  | Ensure the statutory declaration includes the required information and has been correctly witnessed and signed by an appropriate person. If not, request that the person take the necessary steps to do so.<br>The persons who are allowed to witness a statutory declaration are usually included as an appendix to the document. |
|  | Keep a record of the statutory declaration for at least 7 years. |

## Verify the nature and purpose of the business relationship process

This process details out how to verify the nature and purpose of a business relationship as part of carrying out CDD obligations.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Use the Onboarding form to collect information from the customer about the nature and purpose of your business relationship with them.<br>This includes information about why they’re requesting a service from your business and what the customer will do with the services you provide. |
|  | Determine if you can verify the nature and purpose with information already provided by the customer. This can be from what you have seen or heard from your interactions with the customer, or from the Onboarding form.<br>You can do this by:<br>- comparing the claimed nature and purpose with other information from the customer, including their stated occupation, business activities and other requirements as part of their request<br>- considering if you’d consider the claimed nature or purpose to be normal within the scope of your professional experience.<br>If you cannot verify the nature and purpose based on information already available, go to Step 3.<br>For example, where the service being requested doesn't appear to align with what you know about the customer and the nature and purpose they’ve provided, you may need to obtain more information to verify the nature and purpose. |
|  | Attempt to confirm the information provided by the customer using reliable and independent sources (including documents and online databases) and other sources directly relevant to the customer (including their website).<br>For example, does Australian Business Register data or information from other publicly available sources support the stated business activities? Does a company customer claiming to provide a certain type of service have an online presence (for example, business website, social media profiles) which matches their claims?<br>If you’re still unable to verify the nature and purpose based off online sources and other documentation, continue to Step 4. |
|  | Ask the customer to provide evidence which supports the information they’ve already provided about the nature and purpose of the business relationship.<br>For example, evidence of the customer’s occupation or business activities, or evidence of what the customer intends to do with funds generated from a sale. |

## Source of funds and source of wealth check process

This process details how an AML/CTF compliance officer can establish a customer’s source of funds and source of wealth.

### Source of funds

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Ask the client to provide information about where they sourced the funds for the particular transaction or designated service.<br>For example, this may be their salary or wages, or another source, such as the previous sale of a property. |
|  | Collect documents or other forms of evidence from the client which you can use to verify the information provided on reasonable grounds.<br>If the information provided initially is unclear or from an unusual source, ask the client to provide further information. You can explain that this is required under your AML/CTF obligations.<br>Examples of acceptable evidence include:<br>- reliable and independent online sources such as government databases and credible media reporting<br>- a signed letter from the client’s certified practicing accountant confirming their source of funds<br>- a payslip summary or employer letter confirming employment and salary details<br>- a letter from the executor of an estate confirming the distribution of assets to the customer as inheritance<br>- a copy of the sale record or title deed from the sale of property. |
|  | Using the information gathered, consider if you have reason to suspect that:<br>- the client’s funds may have originated from criminal activity<br>- the information provided by the customer appears inconsistent with their known profile and financial state<br>- any part of the client’s funds cannot be linked to legitimate sources.<br>If any of the above apply to the customer complete the Unusual activity report review form and submit an SMR to AUSTRAC in the appropriate timeframe (See Policy document for obligations relating to SMR). |

### Source of wealth

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Ask the customer to provide information about how they acquired their overall wealth and assets.<br>Most customers will have accumulated wealth from multiple sources over time. For example, funds from their salaries, returns from their investments, inheritance. |
|  | Collect documents or other forms of evidence from the customer which you can use to verify the information provided on reasonable grounds.<br>If the information provided initially is unclear or from an unusual source, ask the customer to provide further information. You can explain that this is required under your AML/CTF obligations.<br>Examples of acceptable evidence include:<br>- reliable and independent online sources such as government databases and credible media reporting<br>- a signed letter from the customer’s certified practicing accountant confirming their sources of wealth<br>- pay summaries from current and past employers which indicate wages accumulated over time<br>- a letter from the executor of an estate confirming the distribution of assets to the customer as inheritance<br>- a copy of the sale record or title deed from the sale of property. |
|  | Using the information gathered, consider if you have reason to suspect that:<br>- the customer’s wealth may have originated from criminal activity<br>- the information provided by the customer appears inconsistent with their known profile and financial state<br>- part of the customer’s wealth is explainable from legitimate sources, but most of it is not<br>If any of the above apply to the customer complete the Unusual activity report review form and submit an SMR to AUSTRAC in the appropriate timeframe (See Policy document for obligations relating to SMR). |

## Sanctions check process

The process details how to check if a customer is designated for targeted financial sanctions.

### Personnel carrying out a sanctions check

| Steps | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Download the latest version of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) Consolidated List (the List). It contains a summarised list of all current persons sanctioned by Australia.<br>Note:<br>- As of January 2026, there are only a small number of individuals who hold Australian citizenship who are on the Consolidated List. These individuals either currently reside overseas or are in detention.<br>- Sanctions checks should therefore be a priority for any individuals who do not hold Australian citizenship.<br>- You should regularly check for updates to the Consolidated List in case changes occur. You can subscribe to receive email updates from DFAT when changes are made to the List. |
|  | Search for the person’s name in the List to identify any exact or close matches.<br>If a potential match is found, compare other details you have against details in the List to determine if the person you’re dealing with is sanctioned, such as:<br>- address<br>- citizenship<br>- place of birth.<br>For certain persons, the List may contain other information such as previous names, membership in organisations, document numbers, and other details. |
|  | If the person is a close match for a person appearing on the List:<br>- stop engaging with the customer immediately<br>- don't provide services to the customer<br>- don't deal with their assets<br>- don't return any assets which are currently under your control.<br>You can find more information about how to deal with sanctioned individuals or entities on the [DFAT website](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/guidance/dealing-assets-owned-or-controlled-designated-persons-and-entities). |
|  | Escalate the matter using the Escalation triggers and actions and Escalation form, notifying the AML/CTF compliance officer immediately. |
|  | Document all sanctions checks performed in the relevant Initial customer due diligence form, including:<br>- details about the customer and the sanctioned individual or entity<br>- the ‘last updated’ date of the List that contained the match<br>- screening results (include a copy of the DFAT list used)<br>- any actions taken by the business. |

### Responding to a positive sanctions check

| Steps | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Review the Escalation form and document findings using the Escalations register confirming the positive match. |
|  | After you confirm a positive match for sanctions:<br>- inform the senior manager(s) and governing body<br>- stop all customer activity and freeze any customer assets under the control of the business<br>- notify the Australian Sanctions Office and Australian Federal Police.<br>You can find more information about how to deal with sanctioned individuals or entities on the DFAT website. |

## Politically exposed persons check process

This process sets out how to identify if an individual is a current or former politically exposed person (PEP) as part of initial or ongoing customer due diligence. You must conduct PEP checks on:

- the customer (if they’re an individual)
- anyone representing the customer

| Steps | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Review the customer’s onboarding form and if they've disclosed that they are or any representatives are:<br>- a domestic PEP<br>- a foreign PEP<br>- an international organisation PEP<br>- a related person of a domestic, foreign or international organisation PEP. |
|  | If an individual customer or other related individual has disclosed that they are or have formerly been a PEP:<br>- search the name of the individual and any other information provided to verify the claim and determine which type of PEP they are or were.<br>- review relevant articles, webpages, news items, and other sources returned by the search prompts.<br>Assess up to the first 3 pages of results.<br>If you’re unable to find evidence of the individual’s PEP status, ask the customer to provide supporting information, such as:<br>- an official website listing their current or former position<br>- documentation from an official government agency, international organisation, or other relevant organisation. |
|  | For any other individuals, you need to conduct an online search for those individuals to check that they’re not, or have never been, a PEP.<br>You can do this by searching for the individual’s name with other terms included referring to different types of PEPs (refer to Appendix B of the Onboarding form for a list of PEPs).<br>- For example, ‘[name] AND [government] OR [politics] OR [parliament] OR [court] OR [military] OR [administration] OR [diplomat] OR [state-owned] OR [international]’<br>If the individual has foreign citizenship, residency, or is affiliated with any foreign country, include the country or location in the search terms.<br>Review relevant articles, webpages, news items and other sources returned by the search prompts. Assess up to the first 3 pages of results.<br>Assess if the information you’ve identified indicates that any of the individuals are, or have been, a domestic, foreign or international organisation PEP. |
|  | If you identify that:<br>- the person is a foreign PEP – they are a high risk customer and you will need to complete the enhanced CDD form<br>- the person did not tell the truth about their PEP status – consider whether this was intentional or a mistake.<br>If you believe this is intentional, this is an unusual matter that you must either:<br>- escalate to your compliance officer using the Unusual activity report information form or<br>- if you are the compliance officer – determine if this is a suspicious matter that must be reported to AUSTRAC by using the unusual activity report review form. |
|  | Document the results of PEP checks performed in the Initial customer due diligence form, including:<br>- the search terms used<br>- the sources reviewed in making the assessment<br>- outcomes of the checks. |

## Adverse media check process

This process sets out how to check for adverse (negative) media associated with your customers or personnel.

Use this process to help you determine:

- For personnel – their suitability to hold a particular AML/CTF role
- For customers, their representatives and persons on whose behalf the customer is receiving the designated service – the customer’s ML/TF risk rating and if there is suspicious behaviour.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Use a public search engine and apply the following search parameters:<br>- “[the person’s full name] AND fraud OR corruption OR crime OR arrest OR scandal OR investigation OR lawsuit OR conviction OR bribery OR money laundering OR terrorist OR sanctions”<br>Check search results for up to 3 pages. |
|  | Examine any relevant articles, pages or news links identified in the search, excluding results that clearly do not relate to person being searched.<br>Compare the search results against the information already collected for the person to confirm if they relate to the same individual. |
|  | Determine if the media sources being used are reliable and independent. This includes, but isn't limited to, media articles that refer to:<br>- settled criminal convictions<br>- charges<br>- executed law enforcement powers<br>- arrests<br>- findings of fact in civil proceedings verified through official court of government references.<br>Don’t consider any spent or expunged convictions. |
|  | Consider the context and relevance of any reports. Are the alleged offences a type that could generate significant profits? For example:<br>- money laundering<br>- fraud or corruption<br>- financial crimes<br>- drug trafficking<br>- people smuggling<br>- other serious or organised crimes.<br>Place lower weight on minor or non-profit-generating offences, or offences that are less likely to alter the level of ML/TF risk (such as drink driving).<br>Consider any relevant findings of misconduct or other activity. |
|  | If you identify that the person has allegedly committed a significant profit-generating offence or there is another significant finding from adverse media.<br>For personnel – treat this as a factor that may affect their suitability to hold a particular AML/CTF role.<br>For customers and their representatives – treat this as a factor for their ML/TF risk rating and if you're required to submit a suspicious matter report to AUSTRAC. |

## Identify personnel process

This process sets out the steps to verify the identity of personnel during personnel due diligence.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Use the Personnel due diligence form to obtain the following information from the person:<br>- legal name<br>- any other names they’re known by<br>- date of birth<br>- residential address<br>- unique identifier (licence or passport number)<br>- expiry date related to the unique identifier (if any).<br>You may already hold this information in your systems, otherwise, you can collect it directly from the person with their consent. |
|  | Obtain an original or reliable copy (physical or electronic) of one of the following types of documents to verify their identity:<br>- Option 1: one primary photographic identification document<br>- Option 2: two primary non-photographic identification documents along with a referee statement<br>- Option 3: one primary non-photographic identification document and a secondary identification document, along with a referee statement.<br>Check the document against the identifying information provided to make sure they’re consistent.<br>If the person can’t provide these documents, establish their identity using the alternative identification documents in Annexure A. |
|  | Confirm the person is who they claim to be.<br>If the person has provided photo identification, check their appearance against the photo provided.<br>If the person has provided non-photographic identification documents, examine the reference material provided. |
|  | If you identify any inconsistencies, ask the person to provide additional identification documents to resolve the inconsistency. |

## Annual report to the governing body process

This process details what the AML/CTF compliance officer needs to do to prepare the annual report to the governing body on the operation and effectiveness of the AML/CTF program. The report summarises:

- key compliance activities
- testing results
- recommendations for improvement.

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Complete the report details section including:<br>- date of report<br>- reporting period covered<br>- who completed the report<br>- who reviewed the report (if applicable). |
|  | Provide key recommendations for the governing body to consider or note.<br>Summarise any actions or decisions the governing body should consider.

## Update country risk and risk ratings process

This process outlines the steps to update your Country: Risk assessment in the Risk assessment.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | In the Countries: Risk assessment table in the Risk assessment, list all the countries your business deals with, or chooses not to deal with, when providing designated services.<br>Consider all the following persons (including individuals, body corporates or legal arrangements):<br>- Your customer<br>- Any person on whose behalf they are receiving the designated service (such as beneficiaries to a trust) or any person acting on their behalf.<br>The countries you deal with will be, for the above persons:<br>- for individuals – their country of residency and the country in which they are physically located when the designated service was provided<br>- for body corporates and legal arrangements – where they were formed or registered<br>- any country you deal with in providing designated services to customers (such as where a domestic customer requests funds to be transferred to a bank account in another country). |
|  | Go to the [Basel AML Index](https://index.baselgovernance.org/) website and find the Basel AML Index score for each country listed in Step 1, recording the score in your country risk table.<br>Assign a risk rating based on the Basel score using the system below, entering the risk rating for each country in the ‘Basel AML risk rating’ column of the table:<br>Note: Not all countries are listed on the Basel AML Index. |
|  | Check each country listed in Step 1 against the list of countries identified as high risk by the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions.html) or are subject to sanctions listed by the [Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/sanctions-regimes-currently-implemented-under-australian-sanction-law).<br>In the ‘High-risk country column’, mark ‘Yes’ if the country appears on any of the lists or ‘No’ if it doesn’t.<br>In the Final country risk rating column:<br>- If you marked ‘Yes’, assign a high-risk rating. This overrides the Basel rating.<br>- If you marked ‘No’, use the Basel AML risk rating recorded in step 2.<br>Review your entries for accuracy and completeness.<br>Note: If a country doesn’t appear on the Basel AML Index or in either of the FATF or DFAT lists, consider the materials underpinning the [Basel Index methodology](https://index.baselgovernance.org/methodology) and assign a reasonable risk rating based on these materials. |
|  | Determine your risk appetite by considering the size of your business, the services you provide, the customers you deal with and your ability to apply controls.<br>Your risk appetite should be realistic and capable of being applied consistently in practice.<br>Record your decision by selecting YES or NO in the ‘Risk appetite’ column.<br>If you select NO for a risk factor, you must apply controls to reduce or avoid exposure to that risk.<br>This could include not providing services, or limiting services, to customers that with the risk factor. Record these controls in the last column. |
|  | If you select YES for a risk factor, you must apply controls to manage the risk.<br>Update the endnotes that identify medium and high risk countries at the bottom each relevant Initial customer due diligence forms, or the corresponding section of your existing workflows, to ensure the new risk factor is considered when assessing customer risk.<br>Update, if necessary, relevant Onboarding forms, to ensure that information is collected which allows you to detect those risk factors. |
|  | Seek and record approval for all updates and changes using the Maintain your AML/CTF program form |
|  | Once updates are approved, communicate changes to all affected personnel as soon as practicable and provide training if required.<br>Keep the previous version of the Risk assessment for at least 7 years from the date of the change. |

Example: Adding a new high-risk foreign country as a new risk factor

A jeweller gets a request from a customer wanting to perform a regulated transaction using cash from a high-risk foreign country. The staff member recognises this is unusual, and that this high-risk foreign country isn’t listed in the Risk assessment. The staff member submits an escalation form to the AML/CTF compliance officer.

The AML/CTF compliance officer reviews the referral and confirms that this foreign country isn’t assessed in the business's Risk assessment.

Using the Update country risk rating process, the AML/CTF compliance officer finds:

- The Basel AML Index provides a score of 7.50 for this country

Based on this information, the AML/CTF compliance officer:

1. adds the country to the Country risk assessment table
2. includes the high-risk rating and a decision on the business’ risk appetite related to dealing with this country.

## Updating inherent risk and risk ratings process

This process details how to add or reassess an inherent risk or risk factor in your Risk assessment and how to determine the appropriate rating. This process excludes country risk ratings.

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Identify the risk – an inherent risk or risk factor requiring reassessment, re-rating or adding to the Risk assessment may be identified:<br>- before you provide a new or changed designated service<br>- before a significant change occurs to a delivery channel, customer type or country<br>- with changes in new or emerging technologies<br>- during periodic reviews<br>- as part of an independent evaluation<br>- through AUSTRAC communications, updates to the national risk assessments (NRA) and other risk products<br>- through the Escalation form submitted by customer-facing personnel. |
|  | As a starting point, identify if the inherent risk has already been rated in the most recent NRAs. These are linked in the ‘risk assessment sources’ section of the Risk assessment.<br>Adjust the rating if your business may be exposed to that inherent risk or risk factor when providing designated services.<br>For example, where other regulations affecting your sector prohibit dealing with a certain type of customer or payment method, the inherent risk for your business may be lower.<br>If the risk isn’t covered in a recent NRA:<br>- search the AUSTRAC website for relevant information<br>- check reliable international sources, such as [FATF guidance materials](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html), for additional risk insights.<br>When rating the risk, consider if the risk may assist criminals in any of the following when using your services:<br>- concealing the identity, source of wealth or source of funds of a person<br>- making it easier to access and use<br>- allowing value to be more easily raised, moved or stored through your services<br>- otherwise, allowing your services to be exploited for the purposes of ML/TF. |
|  | Update the Risk assessment by adding the new or reassessed risk factor, inherent risk or risk rating to the relevant section of your Risk assessment.<br>Include the details required by the table. |
|  | Determine your risk appetite by considering the size of your business, the services you provide, the customers you deal with and your ability to apply controls when providing services.<br>Your risk appetite should be realistic and capable of being applied consistently in practice.<br>Record your decision by selecting YES or NO in the Risk appetite column of the relevant Risk factors section.<br>If you select NO for a risk factor, you must apply controls to reduce or avoid exposure to that risk. This could include not providing or limiting services to those customers, or requiring customers to use alternative methods designed to mitigate that risk.<br>Record these controls in the last column of the inherent risk or risk factor in the Risk assessment. |
|  | If you select YES for a risk factor, you must apply controls to manage the risk.<br>- Update Section A1 of each relevant Initial customer due diligence forms, or the corresponding section of your existing workflows, to ensure the new risk factor is taken into account when assessing customer risk.<br>- Update, if necessary, relevant Onboarding forms, to ensure that information is collected which allows you to detect those risk factors. |
|  | Seek approval, record for all updates and changes by following the Maintain your AML/CTF program form |
|  | Once updates are approved, communicate changes to all affected personnel as soon as practicable and provide training if required.<br>Keep the previous version of the Risk assessment for at least 7 years from the date of the change. |

#### Example: Reviewing if a new customer type as a new risk factor

A customer requests to purchase a quantity of precious metals using physical cash. The total purchase price is $15,000, so this is a regulated transaction. The customer asks for an invoice to be issued in the name of their ‘foundation’ registered in an offshore jurisdiction. The staff member recognises that the business has never dealt with a foundation before, and that this entity type may not be covered in the Risk assessment. The staff member submits an escalation form to the AML/CTF compliance officer.

The AML/CTF compliance officer reviews the referral and confirms that foundations aren’t specifically assessed in the business's Risk assessment.

The AML/CTF compliance officer:

- Determines that the business does not want to perform regulated transactions for customer types other than individuals or sole traders.
- Advises the customer that they can complete the transaction, but that they cannot accept a physical currency payment and instead refers them to a bank or other financial institution to pay for the precious metals electronically.

## AUSTRAC communications process

This process details the steps for receiving, assessing and actioning communications from AUSTRAC.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | The AML/CTF compliance officer will:<br>- list themselves as the business contact person through [AUSTRAC Online](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/austrac-online).<br>- subscribe to [AUSTRAC guidance updates](https://www.austrac.gov.au/news-and-media/subscribe-to-updates) and [AUSTRAC InBrief](https://www.austrac.gov.au/news-and-media/austrac-inbrief/form). |
|  | If any other personnel receive or identify any communications directly from AUSTRAC, such as a letter, they must forward it to the AML/CTF compliance officer as soon as practicable. |
|  | Review the communication to determine if it’s relevant to the business’s ML/TF risks.<br>If so, review the Risk assessment and affected parts of the AML/CTF program to identify if updates are needed.<br>Record the communication in the table under Risk assessment sources in the Risk assessment. |
|  | If updates are needed, draft proposed changes in line with the Maintain our AML/CTF program policy and maintain your AML/CTF program form. Continue to Step 4.<br>If no updates are needed, document that the communication was considered and the reason no updated are needed. This process is then complete. |
|  | Submit any proposed changes to the senior manager for review and approval before implementation.<br>If the senior manager rejects proposed changes, record the reasoning and follow the process outlined in Section 4 of the Maintain your AML/CTF program form. |
|  | Once approved, update the relevant documents, and systems and controls.<br>Make sure updates are published and accessible to personnel.<br>Provide communication and training to personnel if required. |

## Independent evaluation process

This process sets out the steps for arranging, conducting and finalising an independent evaluation of the AML/CTF program.

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Appoint a qualified and independent evaluator (see Independent evaluations in the Maintain our AML/CTF program policy).<br>Provide the evaluator with access to relevant AML/CTF policies, systems and records. |
|  | The evaluator reviews the AML/CTF program against legal obligations and effectiveness, providing a written report with findings and recommendations. |
|  | The evaluator submits the report directly to the senior manager, and if separate, to the governing body. The senior manager and governing body must review the report as soon as practicable.<br>If there are no adverse findings, go to Step 8. |
|  | Use the Independent evaluation response form to address any adverse findings. If findings:<br>- aren’t accepted – document the rationale in writing<br>- are accepted – develop an action plan. |
|  | Senior manager and governing body develop and document an action plan that:<br>- categorises findings<br>- assigns each finding to an appropriate personnel member<br>- defines actions, timelines and responsibilities. |
|  | Implement action items and record actions using the Maintain your AML/CTF program form<br>Follow the action plan to make updates to the AML/CTF program.<br>Submit the updated AML/CTF program to the senior manager for approval.<br>Implement approved updates and provide personnel training if required.<br>Save evaluation reports, action plans, forms and correspondence in the compliance records folder. |
|  | Test implemented updates to confirm they’re effective.<br>Provide a written update to the senior manager and governing body.<br>If updates are ineffective, investigate and repeat the process from Step 5 until effective. |
|  | Once the evaluation is complete and, if applicable, all findings have been addressed, close the evaluation process and save all records in the compliance records folder.<br>Add the next evaluation due date in a compliance calendar or register. |

## Annual compliance report process

This process details the steps for completing and submitting an annual compliance report (ACR) to AUSTRAC.

| Step | Actions |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | Make sure that the business contact email is up to date in AUSTRAC Online. They will be notified about the compliance report.<br>Schedule a reminder to prepare the report at the start of each calendar year. |
|  | When notified by AUSTRAC, review the compliance report preview questions to prepare. |
|  | When the reporting period opens on 1 January:<br>- determine if information is needed from other teams and business areas.<br>- gather information required to complete the report.<br>- complete the report questions. It doesn’t need to be completed in one sitting. |
|  | Review and submit the report, checking the report for accuracy and completeness.<br>Submit to AUSTRAC by 31 March via AUSTRAC Online and provide a copy to the governing body.<br>Keep a record of the report for at least 7 years from the date submitted. |

## Escalating matters to the AML/CTF compliance officer process

This process details:

- matters that need to be escalated to the AML/CTF compliance officer
- how to escalate the matter
- what the AML/CTF compliance officer must do to action the escalated matter.

The steps you take under this process will depend on whether the escalation trigger is detected:

- by the AML/CTF compliance officer – Just follow the steps in ‘how to action for the compliance officer’ except those that relate to reviewing escalated information (you will have received this information yourself)
- by another person – Escalate to the compliance officer by following the steps at ‘how to escalate’. The compliance officer then actions by following the steps at ‘how to action for the compliance officer’.

Where an action, process or form does not mention a timeframe, you must complete it as soon as practicable.

### Escalation triggers and actions

The table below sets out triggers for escalation, and the actions that must be taken to escalate matters to the AML/CTF compliance officer for review and actioning.
