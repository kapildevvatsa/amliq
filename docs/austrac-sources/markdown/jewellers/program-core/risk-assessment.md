## Risk assessment

Your business needs to have a money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing (we refer to these as ML/TF) risk assessment.

A risk assessment will help your business identify and assess the ML/TF risks about the:

- services you provide
- customers and jurisdictions you deal with
- delivery channels you use to provide services.

These inform how you develop other processes in your anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) program by ensuring that controls are proportionate to the level of risk you identify.

Under this system, a customer will have either a:

- High risk rating – where at least one high ML/TF risk factor is present or the information you have otherwise warrants this rating. For example, indicators from this risk assessment suggest a customer isn't who they claim to be.
- Medium risk rating – where there are at least 2 medium ML/TF risk factors present or the information you have otherwise warrants this rating (moderate vulnerabilities to ML/TF present).
- Low risk rating – a high or medium ML/TF risk rating isn't warranted under the tests above.

You will also need to update this risk assessment to reflect changes in ML/TF risk (refer to your Maintain our AML/CTF program policy).

### Risk ratings overview

These ratings and descriptions are used throughout the risk assessment.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| High | Represents significant potential ML/TF impact, major damage or effect. Potentially involving serious money laundering, terrorism or proliferation activity. Requires strong and proactive controls. Controls include:<br>- enhanced customer due diligence (CDD)<br>- gathering more information about the customer at onboarding (simplified CDD can’t be used)<br>- ongoing monitoring<br>- more frequent periodic reviews (every year). |
| Medium | Represents moderate potential ML/TF impact with a potential for adverse outcomes if controls don't appropriately manage and mitigate the risk. Controls include:<br>- gathering more information about the customer at onboarding (simplified CDD can’t be used)<br>- ongoing monitoring<br>- periodic reviews every 2 years. |
| Low | Represents minor or negligible potential ML/TF impact, with limited inherent exposure which can be easily contained. Can be managed effectively through standard policies including simplified CDD on onboarding, monitoring and periodic reviews every 3 years. |

The ratings have been reached by considering different risk factors which may make your business vulnerable to exploitation. This is how easily criminals could exploit your designated services to launder money, finance terrorist acts or obtain weapons of mass destruction.

To do this, we’ve considered whether your designated services:

- could be exploited to conceal the identity or source of wealth or source of funds of a person
- could be easily accessed and used
- could allow value to be raised, moved or stored
- are known to be exploited by criminals.

To create your risk assessment, you need to understand the inherent risks and other risk factors associated with providing your designated services.

Based on the sources listed below (see [Risk assessment sources](#risk-assessment-sources)), we’ve provided a list of inherent risks and risk factors known to be relevant to sectors which work directly with precious metals, precious stones or precious products. The risk factors and ratings set out in the risk assessment have been used to develop the controls and processes which form the rest of the AML/CTF program.

Other elements of the program will draw directly on these risk factors to sort your customers into low, medium and high ML/TF risk categories. More thorough checks will apply to higher risk customers.

### Money laundering: Inherent risk

Australia’s 2024 money laundering national risk assessment assesses luxury goods (including jewellery and watches) as having a very high and stable vulnerability to money laundering.

It’s expected that luxury goods will continue to pose a very high vulnerability to money laundering.

The buying, selling and movement of precious metals, stones and products provide an effective and low-cost channel for criminals to launder funds. In Australia, high-value watches and jewellery are commonly identified by authorities in money laundering investigations.

Precious metals, stones and products are attractive for money laundering because:

- they require minimal to no knowledge, skills or expertise to acquire, store and maintain
- they're easily moved into and out of both licit—including second hand—and illicit markets
- the global second-hand market for many forms of luxury goods is expansive, featuring many private sellers and traders, including those based offshore
- they often retain very high value, and in some cases, appreciate in value
- in many cases, they're easily transported.

| Risk rating | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| High | Luxury goods are highly vulnerable to exploitation by criminals wanting to both store and move the proceeds of crime. |

### Terrorism financing: Inherent risk

The 2024 terrorism financing national risk assessment assesses luxury goods (including jewellery and watches) as posing a low and stable vulnerability for being used as a channel to move funds to fund terrorism. It’s expected that luxury goods will continue to pose low risks into the future.

| Risk rating | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Low | The risk of using luxury goods being used to move funds for terrorism financing is assessed as low and stable. |

### Proliferation financing: Inherent risk

The 2024 proliferation financing (PF) national risk assessment doesn't consider jewellery and watches presenting vulnerabilities for proliferation financing.

Law enforcement agencies in other countries have identified cases of precious metals, stones and products being used in proliferation financing, but it's not commonly found. The purchase of other ‘high value goods’, such as rare earth metals and advanced computer chips, represent more significant proliferation financing risks, especially where those goods may be used for both legitimate and illegitimate reasons (these are known as dual-use goods).

| Risk rating | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Low | Law enforcement agencies in other countries only identify jewellery and watches being used in proliferation financing to a limited extent. |

### Designated services: Risk factors

|  | This table supports Step 2 in Part 1 of the Customise the program starter kit guide.<br>Refer to the customise guide for full instructions on completing the table. |
| --- | --- |

| Risk factor | Description of risk | Why it creates ML/TF vulnerability | Inherent risk rating | Risk appetite - would you accept this risk? | If NO, how will you avoid this risk? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High value physical currency transaction | Precious metals, stones, and products purchased using high value physical currency transaction(s) (for example, in Australian dollar notes and coins or a foreign currency equivalent) valued at $50,000 or more. | Precious metals, stones, and product transactions have the potential to involve large sums of money, making them attractive for laundering significant amounts of illicit funds.<br>This risk is magnified when purchases or sales are made using physical currency. This is because these payments bypass financial institutions and are more difficult to track and identify who is making them.<br>The high value of these transactions can indicate the movement of illicit money. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Unusual service requests | Any request for designated services which:<br>- has no apparent economic or legal purpose<br>- would involve unusually complex or large transactions<br>- would involve an unusual pattern of transactions. | Customers who seek unusual services from your businesses are more likely to seek services to disguise or facilitate ML/TF or criminal activity. Criminals often act and transact in ways which may appear illogical or uneconomical to other people. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| High-risk metals and stones | A precious metal, stone or product will be high risk where they satisfy all the following:<br>- effectively retain or increase in value over time<br>- are easy to transport, on-sell and hide in bulk<br>- don't need significant labour to improve before on-selling.<br>This includes, but isn't limited to:<br>- gold (18 carat or more)<br>- platinum<br>- single/loose diamonds (50 points and above).<br>Finished labour-intensive products (such as custom bracelets, watches etc) often require more work to develop and are harder to resell quickly at full value than raw metal or precious stones. | Precious metals, stones, and products that retain or increase in value, and can be on-sold quickly, are more useful in advancing the money laundering process.<br>Metals, stones and products that are difficult to transport, on-sell or that typically decrease in value over time pose a lower ML/TF risk. This is because they reduce the value that's available to criminals at the end of the money laundering process. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Stolen, conflict or counterfeit metals, stones or products | Stolen and counterfeit precious metals, stones and products, and those imported from conflict zones are more likely to be proceeds of crime. | Where precious metals, stones and products are stolen or come from a conflict zone, criminal networks are incentivised to on-sell it quickly to distance themselves from its criminal origins. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Scrap metal dealers | Scrap metal dealers buy, sort, grade and process scrap metal, including precious metals. | Scrap metal dealers are exposed to increased risk as it’s difficult to trace the true source of scrap metal used in jewellery. It could be stolen or used as part of a money laundering scheme. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |

### Designated services: New and emerging technologies

|  | This table supports Step 1 in Part 1 of the Customise the program starter kit guide.<br>Refer to the customise guide for full instructions on completing the table. |
| --- | --- |

New and emerging technologies may affect the ML/TF risks associated with services you provide to customers and the channels you use when providing services. Some examples of technologies which may be vulnerable to exploitation by customers are provided below.

| Kind of technology | Description | Why it creates ML/TF vulnerabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Artificial intelligence (AI) | Businesses are adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to enhance data analysis, decision making and automate repetitive work.<br>Businesses can use AI specifically for their AML/CTF processes. For example:<br>- Encrypted apps and AI work management platforms are being increasingly used by practices to deal with and communicate with their clients.<br>- Digital identity solutions can be used by practices to remotely identify and verify clients during onboarding with AI used to perform micro expression analysis, anti-spoofing checks, fake image detection, and human face attributes analysis. | Leveraging emerging technologies, criminals can hide their identities using techniques such as:<br>- impersonating phone numbers and email addresses (spoofing)<br>- using deepfake images and videos to impersonate another person through digital channels. |
| New jewellery technologies | 3D printing manufacturing technologies are being used to create intricate designs in jewellery and other products made from precious metals.<br>Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is a type of 3D printing that uses a laser to sinter powdered metal, creating high-precision and complex metal parts. This technology is being adopted in the production of high-value metal products. | Sophisticated 3D printing technology may make it easier for the average person to produce jewellery, including criminals who may melt down stolen jewellery to avoid confiscation. |

### Customers: Inherent risk

|  | This table supports Step 1 in Part 1 of the Customise the program starter kit guide.<br>Refer to the customise guide for full instructions on completing the table. |
| --- | --- |

| Kinds of customer | Description | Vulnerabilities to ML/TF risk | Risk appetite - would you deal with these customers? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Individuals and sole traders | An individual customer, other than a sole trader, is a human being with legal capacity to enter into contracts and conduct transactions.<br>A sole trader is an individual customer who owns and operates a business alone, with no legal separation between the owner and the business. Like individuals, sole traders have the legal capacity to enter into contracts and conduct transactions. | The risk level varies based on several personal, transactional and contextual factors.<br>Individual customers can have risk factors that increase the ML/TF risk including their personal background, occupation or nature of business activities, source of funds, financial behaviour and any potential connections to high-risk activities or jurisdictions. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Bodies corporate | A body corporate is a tyle of legal structure with a separate legal identity from their owners or members. A body corporate is recognised by law as having its own rights and obligations.<br>The most common forms of companies are:<br>- private companies (Proprietary Limited)<br>- public companies (Limited)<br>- unlisted public companies (Limited)<br>- owner’s strata corporations<br>- cooperatives<br>- incorporated partnerships | Bodies corporate may be attractive to money launderers as they're easy to set up or purchase with limited knowledge, skills or expertise. They also provide criminals with the capacity to launder high volumes of funds without the activity being directly linked to their own identity.<br>Australian authorities report that bodies corporate are often exploited alongside other types of entities to create complex and opaque legal and group structures.<br>The absence of public information about the beneficial owners of companies can make it difficult to verify if you’re indirectly engaging with a criminal entity. It often requires manual analysis and information gathering. | [ ]   Yes<br>[x]   No |
| Partnerships | A partnership refers to where 2 or more individuals or other legal entities share ownership. A partnership isn't a separate legal entity from its owners.<br>The most common forms of partnerships are:<br>- general partnerships (simpler)<br>- limited partnerships (more complex). | The level of risk will vary based on a range of factors.<br>Partnership customers can have risk factors that increase the ML/TF risk including the:<br>- backgrounds of the partners<br>- nature of their business activities<br>- ownership and control structure<br>- geographic location of the partners<br>- source of partnership funds. | [ ]   Yes<br>[x]   No |
| Trusts | A trust refers to a legal arrangement where one or more trustees hold and manage assets for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries.<br>A trustee may be an individual or a legal entity (such as a company).<br>The most common forms of trusts are:<br>- discretionary trusts (often used for family trusts)<br>- unit trusts (often used by investment firms)<br>- testamentary trusts (often created as part of an estate). | Trusts are attractive vehicles for money laundering as they separate the legal owner of the assets (the trustee) from the beneficiary. This helps conceal the beneficiary’s interests. Trusts may also use a shell company with dummy directors as trustee to make it harder to identify who’s controlling the trust.<br>Australian authorities say trusts are frequently used with companies to form complicated, unclear legal structures.<br>Lack of transparency for trusts in Australia hinders the detection of criminal use, making it harder to identify and seize illicit assets. | [ ]   Yes<br>[x]   No |
| Associations | An association refers to a group of individuals who come together for a common purpose without forming a corporation or similar legal entity. Unless it's registered as an incorporated association, the association itself does not have legal rights or obligations.<br>Associations may be incorporated or unincorporated. | Associations can have risk factors that increase the ML/TF risk including the:<br>- backgrounds of the members<br>- nature of the association’s activities<br>- incorporation status<br>- control and governance structure<br>- geographic location<br>- source and use of association funds.<br>Unincorporated associations don't have the legal right to own assets. Other kinds of customers may sell, buy or transfer assets on behalf of an unincorporated association. | [ ]   Yes<br>[x]   No |
| Government bodies | A government body refers to a legal entity that’s established and recognised by a government to perform specific functions and duties. They have a separate legal identity from their members or employees. A government body is recognised by law as having rights and obligations. | While government entities are typically subject to strong oversight and internal controls, they can still be exploited indirectly or become vulnerable under certain conditions.<br>Government body customers can have risk factors that increase their ML/TF risk including the:<br>- nature of their activities<br>- geographic location<br>- amount of bribery and corruption present<br>- associations with high-risk jurisdictions. | [ ]   Yes<br>[x]   No |

### Customers: Risk factors

|  | This table supports Step 2 in Part 1 of the Customise the program starter kit guide.<br>Refer to the customise guide for full instructions on completing the table. |
| --- | --- |

It’s important to note that the following risk factors will arise if they’re present in any person involved in the designated service, including:

- the customer of the designated service
- any representative of the customer
- any person on whose behalf a customer is receiving a service (for example, a beneficiary of a trust)
- any beneficial owner of the customer.

| Risk factor | Description of risk | Why it creates ML/TF vulnerability | Inherent risk rating | Risk appetite - would you accept this risk? | If NO, how will you avoid this risk? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Individuals that you suspect have committed profit-generating offences | An individual may be involved in crime and use criminal proceeds to buy jewellery and other precious metals, stones and products.<br>Not all criminal offences generate ML/TF risks. Offences that can be used to generate illicit profits include, but aren't limited to:<br>- money laundering<br>- terrorism financing<br>- fraud and other financial crimes<br>- tax evasion<br>- corruption<br>- drug trafficking<br>- people smuggling. | Criminals who have profited from serious crimes are highly likely to try and launder their illicit funds through jewellery purchases. They're likely to continue doing so until their behaviour is detected. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Politically exposed persons (PEPs) (domestic) | Individuals who hold, or have held, senior roles in an Australian government body. This includes their family members and close associates, even if those people haven't held such roles themselves.<br>To establish if a former PEP may still present ML/TF risk, you should consider factors such as:<br>- if the person still has influence over government decisions<br>- the time that has elapsed since the person was a PEP<br>- if the person is still prominent and politically connected. | PEPs often have a public profile and may be vulnerable to corruption and bribery.<br>For example, they may be able to influence any of the following:<br>- government spending and budgets<br>- procurement processes<br>- development approvals and grants. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| PEPs (international organisations) | Individuals who hold, or have held, senior roles in an international organisation. This also includes their family members and close associates, even if those people haven’t held such roles themselves.<br>To establish if a former PEP may still present ML/TF risk, you should consider factors such as:<br>- if the person still has influence over international organisation decisions<br>- the time that has elapsed since the person was a PEP<br>- if the person is still prominent and internationally connected. | PEPs often have a public profile and may be vulnerable to corruption and bribery. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| PEPs (foreign) | Individuals who hold, or have held, senior roles in a foreign country’s government. This includes their family members and close associates, even if those people haven’t held such roles themselves.<br>To establish if a former PEP may still present ML/TF risk, you should consider factors such as:<br>- if the person still has influence over government decisions<br>- the time that has elapsed since the person was a PEP<br>- if the person is still prominent and politically connected. | PEPs often have a public profile and may be vulnerable to corruption and bribery.<br>Foreign PEPs involved in corrupt activity frequently travel outside their jurisdiction to avoid domestic law enforcement. They may seek to move illegally generated funds offshore to avoid confiscation. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Legal structures creating effective anonymity | Where a person’s ownership and control structure is highly complex or unusual, it can be difficult to analyse each layer and identify the beneficial owners. This makes the beneficial ownership ‘effectively anonymous’.<br>Although there are legitimate reasons to use complex ownership and control structures, these structures are often used by criminals to distance themselves from transactions and activity which may attract attention from law enforcement.<br>Importantly, beneficial owners of legal structures aren’t effectively anonymous if you can gather reliable documents which show individuals with ownership or control. For example, although information about trusts isn't usually publicly available, getting the trust deed may show that the trustee and beneficiaries are related individuals. | Given the lack of measures to provide information about beneficial ownership of companies and trusts in Australia, the use of complex legal structures remains a major challenge for law enforcement.<br>This vulnerability is of particular concern as the use of Australian companies and financial infrastructure to evade sanctions is a key proliferation funding threat. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Third party (for individuals) | An individual acts through a third party or intermediary, such as a local representative.<br>Note: this risk doesn't apply if the third party is a reporting entity enrolled with AUSTRAC or the customer isn't an individual (such as a company). | Using a third party or intermediary makes it difficult to:<br>- know who the customer is<br>- know what information the third party receives<br>- verify the source of funds.<br>Law enforcement confiscation of jewellery purchased with proceeds of crime is challenging when third parties are used to conceal ownership. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Customers with significant unexplained wealth | A customer has wealth far greater than their known legal income or assets and is unable to provide a reasonable explanation for the source of their wealth. | Unexplained wealth is a strong indicator of money laundering. It’s a common offence type used in money laundering prosecutions and criminal asset confiscation cases. | High | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Charities and non-profit organisations (NPOs) | Registered charities and legitimate NPOs provide an attractive channel for terrorism financing as donations can be solicited from many individuals, witting and unwitting, and diverted for illicit purposes. Most observed cases relate to outgoing funds to support violent extremism or designated terrorist groups overseas. | As charities and non-profit organisations (NPOs) aren't reporting entities under the AML/CTF Act, detection of suspicious financial activity is therefore reliant on other reporting entities who provide services to NPOs. | Medium | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |
| Low complexity customers | A customer presents with low complexity. For example, a domestic individual or a low complexity legal structure with no other underlying high-risk factors. | There’s low inherent risk associated with these parties in the absence of other risk factors. Low inherent risk doesn't mean no risk. | Low | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |  |

| Email | The customer is engaged or provided access to a service through emails. | Risk factors include:<br>- Higher risk of fraud and scams due to fake or stolen IDs.<br>- Challenges in identifying suspicious behaviour or inconsistencies.<br>- Email address spoofing.<br>- Lack of encryption for document transfer.<br>- Reliance on third-party technologies. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Telephone | The customer is engaged or provided access to a service through the telephone (including calls and text messages). | Risk factors include:<br>- Challenges in identifying suspicious behaviour or inconsistencies.<br>- Phone number spoofing and voice manipulation. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Video conferencing programs | The customer is engaged or provided access to a service through video conferencing programs. | Risk factors include:<br>- Higher risk of fraud and scams due to fake or stolen IDs.<br>- Challenges in identifying suspicious behaviour or inconsistencies.<br>- Potential use of AI.<br>- Reliance on third-party technologies. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |
| Online platforms | The customer is engaged or provided access to a service through an online platform. Including your website, a payment platform, or other third-party apps. | Depending on the platform’s purpose, functionality and regulatory oversight, digital channels are increasingly used to facilitate, conceal or coordinate illicit financial activity. Risk factors include:<br>- Criminals depositing illegal funds with limited visibility.<br>- Higher risk of fraud and scams due to fake or stolen IDs.<br>- Challenges in identifying suspicious behaviour or inconsistencies.<br>- Reliance on third-party technologies. | [ ]   Yes<br>[ ]   No |

## Common ML/TF methods

|  | Common ML/TF methods refer to publicly known trends in how criminals launder money and finance terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Identifying trends and patterns in criminal behaviours will help you to:<br>- understand the nature of existing and emerging ML/TF threats<br>- detect where criminals may try to use these methods when attempting to exploit your services. |
| --- | --- |

The table below shows typical industry-specific ML/TF methods for you to look out for. Note that your business may encounter other methods used by criminals which aren’t listed here.

Use this information as a reference during your daily monitoring and when reviewing customer activity. If you aren’t sure whether something is suspicious, escalate it so the AML/CTF compliance officer can make the assessment and determine next steps.

| Method | Description | How it creates ML/TF risk | Possible red flags/indicators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transactions involving third parties or ‘money mules’ | The use of ‘money mules’ to purchase precious metals, stones and products for ML/TF networks remains a common money laundering method.<br>Although there can be legitimate reasons for transactions involving third parties in the precious metals and stones sector, such as a customer purchasing on behalf of a spouse, transactions that involve multiple parties can increase the money laundering risk and be used to obscure involvement of illicit actors. | Third parties can be used to obscure the involvement of illicit actors in the precious stones and metals sector.<br>Attention should be given where delivery is made to an address that isn't the customers, or where individuals are observed to be interacting with another person in the immediate vicinity of the premises. | - Payer is unrelated to the customer.<br>- Delivery address/name differs from purchaser without clear reason.<br>- Customer appears to be acting on someone else’s instruction, defers to an unseen “buyer” |
| Structuring | Where customers conduct transactions that are below known reporting thresholds (including the $10,000 threshold required to trigger regulation) to avoid triggering AML/CTF reporting obligations. | Customers conducting multiple transactions below reporting thresholds may be trying to evade AML/CTF reporting requirements. | - Multiple purchases just below the businesses cash threshold, or transaction reporting thresholds.<br>- Same customer attempts to use different individuals, cards or stores to split payments.<br>- Rapid sequence of small transactions over short periods. |
| Shell companies | Companies which have no real assets or any legitimate operations. They may hold a bank account and be registered as providing certain services, however, the company will rarely show any indications of a legitimate business. | Domestic and foreign shell companies commonly feature in Australian money laundering investigations. They’re used to create a layer between suspicious transactions and the bad actors behind them.<br>Shell companies often use dummy directors or shareholders on official record which have no actual involvement with the company’s activities. These individuals are used to conceal beneficial ownership and complicate the identification and disruption of money laundering. | - Company with little or no apparent business activity.<br>- Company uses dummy directors or shareholders. |
| Offshore companies | Companies and other legal entities or arrangements may be formed in one country but only ever used in others. These companies are particularly suspicious when they’re based in countries which lack oversight or allow secrecy for beneficial owners (often known as tax havens). | Using offshore companies makes it harder for reporting entities to identify where beneficial owners are located, and where funds ultimately originate from or will ultimately be received.<br>For example, where a person in a high-risk jurisdiction sends funds to an account held by a shell company in a tax haven country prior to a transfer to Australia, the Australian party wouldn’t have visibility of the true source. | - Customer in Australia purchasing high value goods using an offshore company.<br>- Customer is a domestic entity owned by an offshore company in a tax haven or secrecy jurisdiction. |
| Transactions with no economic purpose | Customers should readily be able to articulate the purpose of their transactions. Customers who are unwilling or unable to provide a valid commercial or economic rationale for a transaction should be treated with suspicion. | Customers who cannot provide a commercial or economic rationale for transactions may be suggestive of criminal activity. | - Item(s) don’t fit stated need, budget, or customer profile.<br>- Willing to overpay/ignore price or buys mismatched items.<br>- Vague or shifting explanations for the purchase. |
| Unexpected repeat business | Businesses should have regard to the reputation and level of knowledge a customer has in the product they're dealing in. Particularly where there's a significant amount of repeat business where this isn't expected. | Businesses should have regard to the reputation and level of knowledge a customer has in the product they are dealing in, particularly where there's a significant amount of repeat business where this isn't expected. | - Quick buy–return–buy cycles or repeated similar purchases.<br>- Frequent trades of near-identical items with minimal use.<br>- Unusual urgency to resell or “flip” items back to the store. |
