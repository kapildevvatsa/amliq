## Policy

|  | Before you use these policies<br>Use the Customise the program starter kit guide to customise the personnel and customer sections of the policy document. |
| --- | --- |

Our business has anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) obligations. These obligations apply when we broker the purchase, sale or transfer of real estate. We call this regulated service 'brokering services' throughout this document, although AUSTRAC calls them a 'designated service'.

### What's in our policies

This Policy document details what our business does, and when, to meet our AML/CTF obligations. It doesn't restate these obligations. Instead, it outlines the practical framework we use to meet them.

There are 3 parts to this Policy:

- Part 1: Personnel
- Part 2: Customers
- Part 3: Maintain our AML/CTF program.

### How this works as part of our starter kit

This Policy document is supported by the:

- risk assessment that describes the money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing risks (known as ML/TF risks) faced by our business
- process documents and forms that describe the steps our business takes to comply with our obligations day-to-day.

These documents work together to meet our obligations to:

- manage the personnel we have in AML/CTF roles (such as our AML/CTF compliance officer)
- manage and mitigate the ML/TF risks posed by our customers
- report to AUSTRAC
- maintain our AML/CTF program to make sure it remains effective and stays up to date as ML/TF risks change.

Once approved, our business must follow these policies.

### Key terms and references

#### Forms and processes

Alongside the Process document, we've developed a set of forms to help put this Policy document into practice. Where we refer to relevant processes and forms, we highlight their names like this.

Where we refer to using a form or process, this either means using it directly or using the steps in the form or process in our own systems.

#### Material change

We use the term material change in this document. When we use this term, we mean that we've made updates to a process or document that impacts an outcome of complying with AML/CTF obligations and managing or mitigating ML/TF risks.

For example, carrying out a routine software update on this system, or a change in workflow to the order investigators see in a case management tool, aren’t a material change to how the business complies with its obligations or manages or mitigates risk. It doesn't involve minor changes, such as fixing typos and links.

#### Reasonable

Where we use the word reasonable, such as reasonable steps or reasonable grounds for suspicion, this means that a reasonable person in our position would have taken those steps or formed that suspicion based on the facts, circumstances and information available.

A reasonable person refers to a hypothetical person who displays reasonable or ordinary behaviour or judgement in the circumstances.

#### Single employee business

When we use the term single employee business, we mean that only one person is working for the business.

#### Escalating to an AML/CTF compliance officer

Where we refer to escalating something to an AML/CTF compliance officer, we mean where it's detected by:

- the compliance officer - they action the matter themselves
- other personnel - they escalate it to the compliance officer using either the:
- Unusual activity report information form (for potential suspicious matters)
- Escalation form (for all other matters).

#### Timeframes

|  | We include a timeframe for completion for most actions, processes and forms.<br>Where there isn't a timeframe, we need to complete the action, process or form as soon as practicable. This means we need to do it at the earliest time that is possible and practical, considering the facts and circumstances in the individual case. |

## Part 1: Personnel

This section details how we'll appoint, support and manage the people responsible for our AML/CTF program.

### What's in this section

This part has 3 sections. This table summarises the sections and the corresponding policies.

| Section | Actions | Policy, tools and guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - Align personnel to roles | Identify who will hold each key role:<br>- governing body<br>- senior manager<br>- AML/CTF compliance officer<br>- customer-facing personnel.<br>Assign responsibility for meeting the AML/CTF obligations to each role we've identified. | [Fill key AML/CTF roles policy](#1-fill-key-amlctf-roles)<br>Processes and forms:<br>- AML/CTF roles form<br>- Assign responsibilities form<br>Guidance:<br>- [Governance](https://www.austrac.gov.au/amlctf-reform/reforms-guidance/amlctf-program-reform/develop-your-amlctf-program-reform/step-1-establish-your-governance-framework-reform) |

| - Deliver personnel training | Plan and deliver training to make sure our personnel understand their AML/CTF obligations and can apply the program in their day-to-day work. | [Personnel training policy](#3-personnel-training) |

### 1. Fill key AML/CTF roles

This section shows what we do to make sure our personnel are:

- appointed to AML/CTF roles
- eligible for those roles
- able to carry out the key duties of those roles.

If we become a single employee business, one person will be doing all these roles.

Appoint people to key roles

We have eligible personnel in the following key AML/CTF roles:

governing body

senior manager(s)

AML/CTF compliance officer

any other personnel who will meet our AML/CTF obligations. This includes customer-facing personnel (who need to monitor their activity).

We appoint eligible personnel to these roles by both:

completing the relevant Personnel due diligence forms at 1.1 of the [personnel due diligence policy](#2-personnel-due-diligence)

keeping up to date records of who is in each role using the AML/CTF roles form.

We appoint a suitable AML/CTF compliance officer no later than the following timeline (starting from 1 July 2026), within 28 days of:

providing brokering services

our AML/CTF compliance officer becoming ineligible, changing roles or leaving our business.

We notify AUSTRAC via AUSTRAC Online within 14 days of appointing a new AML/CTF compliance officer.

Responsibilities of the key roles

We assign responsibility for meeting our AML/CTF obligations to each key role using the Assign responsibilities form.

We make sure personnel in each AML/CTF role meet their responsibilities on an ongoing basis.

### 2. Personnel due diligence

We conduct personnel due diligence (PDD) to make sure all personnel in key AML/CTF roles are suitable for their position and can meet their obligations.

Initial PDD

We complete initial PDD on personnel when any of the following occurs:

before new or existing personnel start in a key AML/CTF role, including when they move from one role to another (for example, compliance officer takes on senior manager role)

when there's a change in circumstance that may affect the suitability of personnel to perform the role. Such as criminal charges, financial distress, conflicts of interest or suspicious behaviour.

We complete initial PDD by filling out the following forms for the following roles:

| Role | Relevant form |
| --- | --- |
| Single employee business, or<br>Governing body is also our AML/CTF compliance officer | Personnel due diligence where the compliance officer and governing body are the same person form |
| AML/CTF compliance officer who isn't also the governing body | Personnel due diligence for AML/CTF compliance officer form |
| For all other AML/CTF roles | Personnel due diligence form |

Ongoing PDD

If we identify circumstances that may impact a person's ability to carry out an AML/CTF role, we reassess the suitability of that person. This includes their:

integrity – may include criminal investigations or charges, significant changes in financial arrangements, conflicts of interest or secondary employment

competence – performance reviews, training outcomes and observed conduct.

Our personnel in AML/CTF roles self-report any circumstances that may impact their suitability to hold this role.

We collect and verify any additional information we need to be satisfied that the person is still suitable for the role.

We record the results of ongoing personnel due diligence using the fields of the forms referred to at section 1.2 of this policy.

When personnel aren't suitable

Where we've assessed a person as not being suitable for a role, we take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate:

| Issue | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Minor integrity concern | Take action to lower the risk this person will be exploited by criminal networks or reassign to a less important AML/CTF role |
| Significant integrity concern | Remove from AML/CTF-related duties |
| Minor competency issues | Correct through targeted training, formal warnings, disciplinary actions or reassign to a less difficult AML/CTF role |
| Significant competency issues | Provide the support needed to make sure they gain the skills needed to perform their role. Or replace them in this role with someone with the required skills |
| Ineligible for a key AML/CTF role<br>For example, an AML/CTF compliance officer is no longer an Australian resident | Make sure the role is filled by an eligible person |

### 3. Personnel training

We train our personnel to make sure they can carry out their AML/CTF roles and responsibilities.

Initial training

Personnel starting in an AML/CTF role, or transferring into a role, complete training that's relevant to that role and the responsibilities assigned to it under the Assign responsibilities form.

Personnel who don't complete mandatory training within the required timeframe may face disciplinary action.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer verifies that new starters have completed the required training before granting system access to AML/CTF related platforms.

Ongoing training

Our AML/CTF compliance officer assesses each personnel’s AML/CTF competency in their assigned roles and responsibilities. If:

a person meets their responsibilities, only training about material changes to this program are needed

deficiencies in competency are identified, targeted training is provided to address them

deficiencies cannot be corrected through training, the role is reassigned.

Our personnel complete training that's specific to their AML/CTF role on any material changes to our AML/CTF program.

Training content and delivery

Our AML/CTF compliance officer determines the content, delivery format and frequency of training.

We develop training to help personnel understand:

the ML/TF risks we may reasonably face in providing brokering services and indicators of criminal exploitation

the specific AML/CTF obligations that must be met in their role

how to apply the processes in our AML/CTF program to meet these obligations.

Training includes scenario-based exercises to test understanding and decision making.

When using third-party training providers, our AML/CTF compliance officer assesses and approves the content to make sure it meets our AML/CTF training requirements.

Role-specific training requirements

For personnel with an AML/CTF role, our training covers how to:

identify ML/TF risks and indicators of criminal activity, and the ML/TF risks we're willing to take on, as outlined in the risk assessment

use this information to risk rate customers, identify suspicious matters, restrict service offerings and offboard customers as outlined in this Policy document

handle confidential material relating to reporting and avoid [tipping off](#6-tipping-off)

meet our customer due diligence obligations when onboarding customers and throughout the course of our business relationship

detect and escalate matters that must be referred to our AML/CTF compliance officer

meet any other obligations assigned to the role under the Assign responsibilities form.

Training program reviews and updates

Our AML/CTF compliance officer reviews training materials if:

ML/TF risks change

material changes are made to our AML/CTF program

AUSTRAC releases communications relevant to our business.

Our training materials reflect all relevant updates, including regulatory changes, emerging ML/TF risks and changes to our business processes.

## Part 2: Customers

This section details how to:

- deal with customers
- conduct customer due diligence (CDD)
- report to AUSTRAC.

A 'customer' includes both the buyer and seller of real estate. This means we complete the below steps on both our direct customer and any counterparty (e.g. for a seller's agent, the buyer).

### What's in this section

This part has 7 sections. This table summarises the sections and the corresponding policies.

### 1. Initial customer due diligence

We complete initial customer due diligence (initial CDD) to:

- identify our customers and their representatives, beneficiaries and beneficial owners
- identify our customers’ ML/TF risk
- manage and mitigate this ML/TF risk.

When we complete initial CDD

We complete initial CDD in the timeframes below:

For a direct customer – before signing a brokering agreement

For a counterparty – before exchange of contracts

To ensure we meet this deadline, we can start completing initial CDD from the moment it is reasonable to conclude that an engagement may involve providing a brokering service.

|  | Under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), we can collect personal information when it is reasonably necessary for our functions and activities, including to meet our legal obligations (Australian Privacy Principle 3.2).<br>To comply with our obligations as set out in paragraph 1.1, we can complete initial CDD in the window between:<br>- reasonably concluding that an engagement may involve providing a brokering service<br>- the deadline at paragraph 1.1.<br>For example, for a direct customer, we can reasonably conclude that they are seeking brokering services form the moment they approach us for these services. This means we complete initial CDD between this approach and signing the brokering agreement.<br>For a counterparty, however, this window is often only between:<br>- agreement being reached on the price for real estate - either through the buyer being successful at auction or the parties agreeing to a price under private tender<br>- the exchange of contracts.<br>This often will not be enough time for us to complete initial CDD. For these counterparties, we will often used the delayed initial CDD parts of the Initial CDD form to complete initial CDD on them after exchange of contracts.<br>This will allow us to delay initial CDD until the earlier of: as soon as practicable, 15 days after exchange of contracts or before settlement. |
| --- | --- |

When we can delay initial CDD

We can delay initial CDD if permitted under the relevant Initial CDD form.

We don't delay initial CDD just because the timeframes are inconvenient for us or our customers.

When we delay initial CDD, we do all of the following:

complete initial CDD in the permitted timeframe under the relevant Initial CDD form

don't deal with the customer's money, property or virtual assets (other than holding in an account or on deposit) or make money, property or virtual assets available to them, before initial CDD is completed

mark contracts, correspondence and other documents issued to the customer with the words 'unverified customer'

any other actions that are appropriate to mitigate and manage the ML/TF risk.

How we complete initial CDD

We complete initial CDD by doing all of the following:

determine if our customer is an individual, body corporate, partnership, unincorporated association, trust or government body

collect the information in the Onboarding form for that kind of customer

fill out the Initial CDD form for that kind of customer

if required, work with a conveyancer or real estate agent to verify customer information by following the steps set out at section 4 below.

If any of the events at paragraph 1.1 of the [escalation and enhanced CDD policy](#4-escalation-and-enhanced-cdd) occur, we escalate them to our AML/CTF compliance officer to action before completing initial CDD. We stop providing brokering services until the compliance officer notifies us that we can continue.

This includes any of the following:

potential suspicious matters

high-risk customers

a new customer, designated service, delivery channel, country or ML/TF risk factor, method or indicator that isn't in our risk assessment

complex beneficial ownership checks

a positive match on a sanctions check.

If any of the events at paragraph 1.2 of the [escalation and enhanced CDD policy](#4-escalation-and-enhanced-cdd) occur, we escalate this to our AML/CTF compliance officer to report but we don't need to stop providing brokering services.

This includes any of the following valued at $10,000 or more (or the foreign currency equivalent):

physical currency (including notes and coins) transaction

cross-border movement of physical currency and/or bearer negotiable instruments.

What we do if a counterparty doesn't cooperate

If a counterparty doesn't cooperate with our requests for information, we:

fill out the relevant Onboarding form with information known to us

fill out the relevant Initial CDD form with information known to us

delay initial CDD if available under the relevant Initial CDD form

ask the counterparty's conveyancer and any representative if they're willing to work with us to complete initial CDD and inform them of any refusal from the counterparty to cooperate

mitigate and manage ML/TF risk factors identified through ongoing monitoring of the counterparty’s transactions and behaviour until settlement by following the [ongoing CDD policy](#we-complete-initial-customer-due-diligence-initial-cdd-to)

take any other reasonable steps to have the counterparty cooperate

record any steps taken.

### 2. Ongoing customer due diligence

We follow these policies to manage and mitigate our customer's ML/TF risks from the moment they approach us for a brokering service or we offer a brokering service to them, and throughout the course of our business relationship.

While we remain in a business relationship with a customer, we:

- monitor them for reportable activity and changes in ML/TF risk
- review their information periodically and in response to triggers.

Ongoing customer due diligence

We monitor our customer for all of the following:

unusual transactions and behaviours

any significant changes in the customer’s ML/TF risk, the information we've collected and verified on them or the nature of the business relationship

any matters referred to in the [escalation and enhanced CDD policy](#4-escalation-and-enhanced-cdd).

We record sufficient information about our customers, related transactions and behaviours to support effective monitoring. This includes, but isn't limited to, comparing information recorded from monitoring against:

any present ML/TF risk factors, ML/TF methods and indicators and indicators of unusual or criminal behaviour listed in our risk assessment

any physical currency transaction, or cross-border movement of physical currency and/or bearer negotiable instruments, valued at $10,000 or more (or the foreign currency equivalent)

general customer information, including previous transactions and behaviour recorded throughout the business relationship. This establishes a baseline for what is 'normal' and 'unusual' behaviour for each customer.

Periodic customer reviews

We do periodic reviews of the customer's information by completing the Periodic review and update form.

Where a periodic review identifies that updates are needed to a customer’s information or ML/TF risk rating, we make these updates to make sure our customer information is accurate and complete.

We conduct reviews at the following frequency, starting from the date that initial CDD was last completed on the customer:

High risk customer – Every 12 months

Medium risk customer – Every 2 years

Low risk customer – Every 3 years

If the review period has expired, we complete the periodic review before we continue to provide brokering services to the customer if we have doubts about the accuracy of existing customer information. If we don't have doubts about the accuracy of existing customer information, we complete the periodic review as soon as practicable.

As most real estate transactions are resolved within 12 months, for many of our customers no periodic review is needed.

We conduct more frequent periodic reviews if justified by customer activity or risk.

Triggers for review

We conduct a review of the customer’s information and ML/TF risk ratings by completing the Trigger event review form if any of the following occur:

there's been a change in our relevant Risk assessment which impacts how we identify and assess customer ML/TF risk

there's a change in our customer's details and beneficial ownership (for body corporates, government bodies and legal arrangements, who owns or controls them)

our customer requests a new brokering service

our customer becomes, or is identified as a foreign PEP, or a high-risk domestic or international organisation PEP

our customer becomes a person designated for targeted financial sanctions

we identify unusual transactions or behaviours listed in our Risk assessment through customer monitoring

any other event that causes us to question if the customer’s information or ML/TF risk rating is accurate, current or adequate.

If our triggered review identifies that we need to update the customer’s information or ML/TF risk rating, we make these updates to ensure our customer information remains accurate and complete.

### 3. Pre-commencement customer due diligence

We conduct lighter due diligence on customers who were receiving brokering services on 1 July 2026 (these are called pre-commencement customers).

Pre-commencement customers

We monitor these customers for changes in the nature and purpose of our business relationship which may result in any of the triggers under the [escalation and enhanced CDD policy](#4-escalation-and-enhanced-cdd).

If a suspicious matter report is submitted about the customer during this business relationship, we complete initial CDD under the [initial CDD policy](#initial-customer-due).

If a pre-commencement customer requests another brokering service after 1 July 2026, we complete initial CDD on the client under the [initial CDD policy](#1-initial-customer-due-diligence) before starting to provide this service to the customer.

### 4. Escalation and enhanced CDD

We escalate any of the matters in this policy to our AML/CTF compliance officer to action when we detect them. To implement this policy, we follow the Escalating matters to the AML/CTF compliance officer process

What we escalate and action

We escalate the following to our AML/CTF compliance officer to action. We stop providing brokering services unless the compliance officer informs us, we can continue.

| Event | AML/CTF compliance officer action |
| --- | --- |
| Potential suspicious matter detected | Complete the Unusual activity report review form and report the suspicious matter to AUSTRAC if required.<br>If there are no reasonable grounds for the suspicion, we can tell personnel to resume providing brokering services.<br>If there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion, report the suspicion within the timeframes in the reporting policy and proceed to the 'suspicious matter report will be made' event below. |
| Customer is high risk, and/or a suspicious matter report will be made and we decide to continue providing brokering services to the customer | Follow the steps in the Enhanced CDD form.<br>Obtain senior manager approval before telling our personnel they can resume providing brokering services. |
| A new customer, designated service, delivery channel, country or ML/TF risk factor, method or indicator is detected that either:<br>- isn't in our risk assessment<br>- outside our risk appetite, as stated in our risk assessment. | Review and update the program by following the steps in the Maintain your program form.<br>Complete these steps before telling personnel they can resume providing brokering services. |
| Complex beneficial ownership checks - checking who owns or controls a trust, body corporate or government body | Follow the Ownership and control mapping process and record the results in the Initial CDD form.<br>Complete these steps before telling personnel they can resume providing brokering services |
| The customer is on a sanctions list | We can't continue the transaction, handle their property or give them access to property.<br>Follow the Sanctions check process and record the results using the Escalation register.<br>Complete all these steps as soon as possible. |

We escalate the following to our AML/CTF compliance officer to report. We don't stop providing brokering services if we escalate any of these:

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| A brokering service involves any physical currency transaction valued at $10,000 or more, or the foreign currency equivalent | Make a threshold transaction report via AUSTRAC Online within 10 days of the transaction by following the reporting policy |
| Any cross-border movement of physical currency and/or bearer negotiable instruments valued at $10,000 or more, or the foreign currency equivalent | Make a cross-border movement report via AUSTRAC Online within the timeframes outlined under the reporting policy |

We make sure that all information provided to our AML/CTF compliance officer is accurate and sufficient to allow them to take appropriate action.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer will make sure that they provide personnel with information from the above actions that's relevant to the personnel's AML/CTF role. This includes if they can continue providing brokering services to the customer.

### 5. Reporting

We escalate reportable matters to our AML/CTF compliance officer, who reports them to AUSTRAC within the required timeframes.

Responsibilities

All our personnel:

detect potential suspicious matters, threshold transactions or cross-border movements following our monitoring obligations under the [ongoing customer due diligence policy](#we-complete-initial-customer-due-diligence-initial-cdd-to)

escalate any potential suspicious matters, detected threshold transactions or cross-border movements to our AML/CTF compliance officer consistent with the [escalation and enhanced CDD policy](#4-escalation-and-enhanced-cdd).

Our AML/CTF compliance officer:

makes sure all reported information is accurate, complete and free from unauthorised change, is contained in the approved form and is reported within statutory timeframes

makes sure that all reports to AUSTRAC contain all reportable information that's known or reasonably available to our business

investigates escalations of potential suspicious activity to determine if a suspicious matter report is needed

submits suspicious matter reports (SMRs) to AUSTRAC after notifying our governing body

reviews escalations relating to possible threshold transaction reports (TTR) and cross-border movement (CBM) reports

prepares and submits TTRs and CBM reports to AUSTRAC

notifies personnel of any information they need to help discharge their AML/CTF obligations (including, for SMRs, if they can start or continue to provide designated services to the customer)

provides reports to AUSTRAC and our governing body on AML/CTF compliance at least annually.

Our governing body:

oversees AML/CTF compliance and reviews reports provided by our AML/CTF compliance officer

makes sure we have adequate resources, systems and appropriate oversight mechanisms to meet our reporting obligations.

Suspicious matter reports (SMRs)

Our AML/CTF compliance officer completes the steps in the Unusual activity report review form to determine if a suspicious matter report must be made.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer submits a suspicious matter report if both of the following are satisfied:

We are starting or proposing to provide a brokering service, or someone asks for a brokering service

Our AML/CTF compliance officer has reasonable grounds to suspect any of the following:

information our business has may be relevant to an offence or proceeds of crime laws

a customer, possible future customer or their representative isn’t who they claim to be

a person is planning an ML/TF offence using a brokering service

Where our AML/CTF compliance officer forms reasonable grounds for suspicion, they submit an SMR to AUSTRAC via AUSTRAC Online within:

24 hours for suspicions relating to terrorism financing

3 business days for all other suspicions.

Where a suspicious matter report needs to be submitted, and we decide to continue providing brokering services to a customer, we follow our [escalation and enhanced CDD policy](#enhanced-customer-due-2) in relation to the customer.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer submits additional SMRs if new information leads to a further suspicion under section 2.2 of this policy.

Only the following persons may access information about if an SMR was made or needs to be made:

the AML/CTF compliance officer, governing body and any senior manager

any person who needs access to the information for the practice to meet its obligations – for example, to legal counsel to obtain legal advice.

We avoid providing any information to customers or other parties that could amount to a tipping off offence. See [tipping off](#6-tipping-off).

Threshold transaction reports (TTRs)

Our AML/CTF compliance officer submits a TTR when our brokering service involves a threshold transaction involving $10,000 or more in physical currency (such as bank notes or coins) or the foreign currency equivalent (known as a threshold transaction).

Our AML/CTF compliance officer submits a TTR to AUSTRAC via AUSTRAC online within 10 business days after the transaction takes place.

Cross-border movement (CBM) reports

Our AML/CTF compliance officer submits a CBM report when we accept or receive the cross-border transfer of physical currency and/or bearer negotiable instruments (BNIs) valued at $10,000 or more or the foreign currency equivalent.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer submits a CBM report to AUSTRAC via AUSTRAC Online:

before passing through customs when physically carrying physical currency and/or BNIs in or out of Australia

before mailing or shipping physical currency and/or BNIs in or out of Australia

within 5 business days of receipt, when physical currency and/or BNIs are received from outside Australia.

Annual compliance report (ACR)

We prepare and submit an ACR by following the Annual compliance report process.

We submit the ACR to AUSTRAC by 31 March via AUSTRAC Online.

A copy of the ACR is provided to the governing body after being submitted to AUSTRAC.

### 6. Tipping off

We won't disclose information on suspicious matter reports (SMRs) where this would or could reasonably be expected to prejudice an investigation.

Tipping off prohibition

We don't disclose any of the following information where doing so would or could reasonably be expected to prejudice an investigation:

information that establishes we submitted an SMR, or that a requirement to submit an SMR has been triggered

a report made or prepared for the purposes of meeting our SMR obligations, including unusual activity reports, or information that was recorded for the purpose of potentially including in an SMR

any document with information contained in an SMR, including draft or final SMRs

that we are, or were required to give, or have given information or produced a document in response to a request from a law enforcement or investigations authority (including AUSTRAC) to provide further information about an SMR or other ML/TF risks and crimes

a customer is being investigated by us, a law enforcement agency or other government authority.

We may disclose information mentioned in this policy to the AUSTRAC CEO or an AUSTRAC entrusted person (including by submitting SMRs and providing information to AUSTRAC).

Contact with customers

We may request more information from a customer to meet our AML/CTF obligations:

if a customer asks for the reason, we say it's needed to meet AML/CTF obligations and/or business policies

we do not disclose that the request is being made because of a suspicious activity or in response to a notice or investigation.

If we offboard a customer because of suspicious activity, and the customer asks for the reason, we provide genuine reasons for doing so that don't mention any information listed in section 1.1 of this policy (including that their behaviour is suspicious).

This may include that the customer’s conduct or ML/TF risk wasn't consistent with the terms of our brokering agreement conditions as outlined in the [offboarding policy](#7-offboarding).

Personnel knowledge of SMRs

Only the following persons may access information at section 1.1 of this policy:

the AML/CTF compliance officer, governing body and any senior manager

any person who needs access to the information for the practice to meet its obligations - for example, to legal counsel to obtain legal advice, AUSTRAC or law enforcement

any persons listed in section 1.2 of this policy.

We make sure that records of information listed in section 1.1 of this policy, are securely stored and only made available to these personnel.

After submitting an SMR, our AML/CTF compliance officer will:

inform the personnel who raised the suspicion of the information, including ML/TF risks, needed to meet their AML/CTF responsibilities

give the personnel who raised the suspicion any additional directions, which may include offboarding the customer for the reasons outlined in the [offboarding policy](#7-offboarding)

not disclose that they've submitted an SMR in relation to the customer or were required to do so to anyone, but the personnel mentioned in section 3.1.

Other than to the personnel mentioned in section 3.1, we do not confirm if an SMR has been submitted.

If personnel other than those mentioned in section 3.1 become aware that an SMR has been filed or was required to be filed, they notify our AML/CTF compliance officer they know this.

### 7. Offboarding

We follow this policy when we decline or stop providing brokering services to customers that fall outside our risk appetite or would cause us to fail to meet our AML/CTF obligations.

Risk appetite and customer acceptance

The ML/TF we're willing to accept, and what we'll do to avoid the risks we aren't willing to accept, are outlined in the risk appetite columns in our Risk assessment.

Risk avoidance measures may include limiting or placing conditions on brokering services or refusing to provide brokering services or offboarding a customer when this risk factor arises.

Brokering agreement conditions

Our standard brokering agreement includes clauses that allow us to:

decline new customers who fall outside our risk appetite

stop acting for customers where they fall outside our risk appetite

refuse or delay services where CDD information isn't provided

adjust services if controls are needed to manage risk

report suspicious matters despite confidentiality obligations and where the customer is offboarded.

Offboarding triggers

We consider offboarding where:

required to offboard customers under the risk appetite columns of our risk assessment

under the [escalation and enhanced CDD policy](#enhanced-customer-due-2), our senior manager doesn't approve starting or continuing to provide brokering services to a customer

a customer fails to provide the required information within a reasonable timeframe.

Decision making and documentation

Offboarding decisions are approved by a senior manager.

If we decide to offboard or keep a customer, we record:

reasons for offboarding or keeping the customer

all information requests and dates

customer responses and dates

wording used to notify the customer

controls applied where the relationship continues.

How to offboard a direct customer or counterparty

As outlined in the [tipping off policy](#6-tipping-off), if we offboard a customer because of suspicious activity, and the customer queries the reason, we provide genuine reasons for doing so that don't mention the suspicious activity.

We offboard a direct customer (a seller for a seller’s agent) by both:

stopping providing brokering services to this customer

justifying this action to the customer by referring to the clauses of our amended brokering agreement at section 2.1 of this policy.

We offboard a counterparty (a buyer for a seller’s agent) by both:

stopping providing brokering services to our direct customer in relation to the counterparty (such as informing the seller that we can’t broker the sale with this particular buyer but can for other buyers)

justifying this action to our direct customer by using and referring to the clauses of our amended brokering agreement at section 2.1 of this policy.

### 1. Maintain our AML/CTF program

We maintain our AML/CTF program to make sure it remains:

- current
- accurate
- compliant with regulatory obligations.

We keep our program up to date

Where an event below occurs, we escalate this to the AML/CTF compliance officer to review and, if necessary, update the program to make sure it addresses our ML/TF risks and meets our obligations.

| Event | When we update the program | How we update the program |
| --- | --- | --- |

AUSTRAC communications

We monitor and action AUSTRAC communications that are relevant to our ML/TF risk by following the AUSTRAC communications process.

Communication and training

We provide written updates to our governing body when we update the Risk assessment.

We make sure approved updates to our AML/CTF program are given to any personnel with a relevant AML/CTF role.

Where updates affect operations or AML/CTF compliance responsibilities, training is delivered to affected personnel.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer is responsible for making sure personnel understand the changes and tracking completion of training.

### 2. Periodic effectiveness checks

Our AML/CTF compliance officer periodically checks whether our program is operating effectively and reports annually to the governing body.

When we do effectiveness checks

Our AML/CTF compliance officer does quarterly effectiveness checks covering:

suspicious matter reports (SMRs)

threshold transaction reports (TTRs)

AML/CTF compliance officer and senior manager functions

customer onboarding, monitoring alerts, and all customer due diligence (CDD) processes (initial, ongoing, enhanced, pre-commencement).

When our AML/CTF compliance officer and governing body remain reasonably satisfied that our AML/CTF program is operating effectively, and they record their reasoning, these effectiveness checks are conducted less frequently.

At a minimum, we do effectiveness checks annually to inform our AML/CTF compliance officer's report to our governing body.

Additional effectiveness checks are to be performed whenever there are findings from the independent evaluation, particularly adverse findings, unusual personnel activity, or other compliance issues are identified.

We do effectiveness checks using the following forms:

Periodic effectiveness testing summary

SMR effectiveness check

TTR effectiveness check

CBM report effectiveness check

Compliance officer and senior manager effectiveness check

Enhanced CDD effectiveness check.

Corrective actions

All suggested actions to address matters identified in effectiveness checks must be approved by a senior manager before implementation.

Where corrective actions aren't approved, our AML/CTF compliance officer must follow the process set out in section 4 of the Maintain your AML/CTF program form.

If corrective action fails to correct the identified issue, new corrective actions must be developed and implemented.

Documentation and reporting

Effectiveness check outcomes must be available to our senior manager, governing body and AUSTRAC upon request.

The governing body must review periodic effectiveness check reports and direct additional action where deficiencies remain unresolved.

Communication and training

All affected personnel must be informed of changes to processes resulting from effectiveness checks.

Relevant personnel must receive training to make sure they understand and can apply updated processes.

Reporting to the governing body

Our AML/CTF compliance officer provides a written report to our governing body by following the Annual report to the governing body process and using the Annual report to the governing body form at least annually, covering:

compliance with our AML/CTF program

effectiveness of policies and controls

training and awareness activities

risk assessment outcomes, including new or emerging risks

customer onboarding numbers, including high-risk customers and PEPs

sanctions and watchlist screening results

SMR, TTR, CBM report volumes

records of AUSTRAC communications and actions taken.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer doesn't need to complete this report if both:

our business is an individual (a sole trader business)

our AML/CTF compliance officer is also our governing body.

### 3. Independent evaluations

We have an independent evaluation of our program every 3 years, or more frequently if our governing body thinks it's needed due to our size, nature and complexity.

How we arrange an independent evaluation

We must arrange an independent evaluation and respond to adverse findings by following the Independent evaluation process.

Evaluator requirements

We select an evaluator that:

has suitable experience and knowledge of us, our industry, ML/TF risks and AML/CTF obligations

hasn't have been involved in developing, implementing or using our AML/CTF program, systems or controls

is independent of the work areas being evaluated

is granted access to all relevant materials.

Evaluation requirements

As part of the evaluation, our evaluator:

reviews the steps taken by us when undertaking or reviewing our ML/TF risk assessment, including how ML/TF risks are identified, analysed, documented and rated

assesses if the ML/TF risk assessment process complies with the requirements of the Act, the Regulations and the Rules

evaluates if the ML/TF risk assessment is current and has been appropriately reviewed or updated in response to changes in our risk profile, products, services or regulatory obligations

evaluates if the design of the AML/CTF policies are appropriate to our nature, size and complexity

evaluates whether the design of our AML/CTF policies appropriately incorporate the mandatory elements required under the Act, the Regulations and the Rules

assesses if our AML/CTF policies clearly articulate obligations, roles, responsibilities and processes that enables us to comply with the law and effectively manage our ML/TF risks

tests the operational implementation of our AML/CTF policies, including sampling and review of customer due diligence files, reporting records, transaction monitoring outputs, governance documentation and any other relevant evidence of compliance

evaluates if any identified non-compliance is isolated or systemic, assess its potential ML/TF risk impact, and provide recommendations to address or remediate deficiencies in compliance with our AML/CTF policies

tests and evaluates the effectiveness of our ML/TF risk identification and assessment processes, including the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of risk identification across customers, transactions, products, services and delivery channels

tests and evaluates if our risk mitigation and control measures, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, reporting processes, governance arrangements and assurance activities are effective in managing the ML/TF risks reasonably faced by us in providing our brokering services.

Reporting

Our evaluator provides a written report containing the findings on the assessed matters to any senior manager responsible for approving changes to our AML/CTF program and, if separate, to our governing body.

The written report contains findings on the:

evaluation of the steps taken by us when undertaking or reviewing our ML/TF risk assessment, against the requirements of the Act, the regulations and the Rules

evaluation of the design of our AML/CTF policies, against the requirements of the Act, the regulations and the Rules

testing and evaluation of our compliance with our AML/CTF policies

testing and evaluation if we're appropriately identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating the ML/TF risks that we may reasonably face in providing our brokering services.

Findings and actions

All adverse findings must be reviewed.

If we accept the results of the findings, we'll create and implement an action plan, using the action plan in the Independent evaluation response form to resolve accepted deficiencies.

The action plan must be approved by our senior manager after being completed. Once approved it needs to be implemented.

The relevant Risk assessment and any relevant policy, procedure, system or control must be reviewed after approval of the action plan. Any changes to the relevant Risk assessment or relevant policy, procedure, system or control must be conducted under our [Maintain our AML/CTF program policy](#1-maintain-our-amlctf-program).

If our governing body doesn't accept an adverse finding, the reason is documented using the Independent evaluation response form.

Our AML/CTF compliance officer implements the agreed action plan under the oversight of our senior manager.

### 4. Record keeping

We make and keep records relating to AML/CTF compliance and our AML/CTF program.

How and when we keep quality records

We keep records of our risk assessment and any updates to this risk assessment, along with all records necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Policy document. This includes, but isn't limited to, any of the following referred to in the document:

a copy of any form, or completed field of a form

any record necessary to demonstrate compliance with a process.

We keep all CDD records for 7 years following the end of our business relationship or 7 years after the date of the last transaction.

We also keep records of transactions, including transaction records given to us by the customer and the minimum records required to allow the reconstruction of individual transactions, including the following:

date and time the transaction was completed

the type of transaction, including the amount and currency used

the customer's information

the payment method.

We keep transaction records for 7 years after the record is created or for 7 years from receiving the transaction record from the customer (as applicable).

We keep all other records for 7 years from the point a previous version is no longer needed to prove compliance.

All records kept under this policy are:

securely stored and accessible only to authorised personnel

kept confidential

capable of being audited and accessible by authorised personnel

accurate and free from any unauthorised change

in the English language, or in a form that can be readily accessible and convertible into writing in the English language.
