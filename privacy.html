        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">1. Overview</h2>
          <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to handling personal information in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). This policy describes what information is (and is not) collected when you use this website (tranche2compliance.com.au, branded as "T2C").</p>
          <p class="mt-2"><strong>Key point:</strong> This website is designed to minimise data collection. We do not collect, store, or transmit personal information through the interactive tools on this website.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
          <p>To be clear about what this website does <strong>not</strong> do:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>No server-side data collection:</strong> Data you enter into the interactive tools (checklists, forms, risk assessments, quizzes) is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage (<code>localStorage</code>). It is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>No analytics or tracking:</strong> We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any other analytics or tracking service.</li>
            <li><strong>No cookies:</strong> This website does not set cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>No advertising:</strong> We do not serve advertisements or use advertising tracking technologies.</li>
            <li><strong>No email collection:</strong> The "Notify Me" email field on "coming soon" pages is a non-functional placeholder. No email address entered into that form is stored or transmitted.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">3. Information That May Be Collected</h2>
          <p>Although we minimise data collection, some information may be collected through the normal operation of the website:</p>

          <h3 class="font-medium text-slate-900 mt-3">3.1 Server Logs</h3>
          <p>Our hosting provider (AWS) may automatically collect standard server log information when you visit this website, including:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
            <li>your IP address;</li>
            <li>the date and time of your visit;</li>
            <li>the pages you accessed;</li>
            <li>your browser type and operating system; and</li>
            <li>the referring URL (the page that linked you to this website).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-1">This information is collected automatically by the hosting infrastructure and is used solely for website security, performance monitoring, and troubleshooting. We do not use server logs to identify individual users or for marketing purposes.</p>

          <h3 class="font-medium text-slate-900 mt-3">3.2 Third-Party CDN</h3>
          <p>This website loads the Tailwind CSS framework from a content delivery network (CDN) operated by Tailwind Labs. When your browser requests this resource, the CDN provider may receive your IP address and standard request headers. We do not control the CDN provider's data practices. You can review Tailwind Labs' privacy practices on their website.</p>

          <h3 class="font-medium text-slate-900 mt-3">3.3 Browser Local Storage</h3>
          <p>Data you enter into the interactive tools is stored in your browser's <code>localStorage</code>. This data:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
            <li>remains entirely on your device;</li>
            <li>is not transmitted to us or any third party;</li>
            <li>can be exported by you using the built-in export feature;</li>
            <li>will be deleted if you clear your browser data; and</li>
            <li>may include information you choose to enter, such as business names, client details, risk assessment answers, and compliance checklist responses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-1"><strong>Important:</strong> Because this data is stored only in your browser, we cannot access, recover, or restore it. You are responsible for backing up any data you wish to retain.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">4. How We Use Information</h2>
          <p>To the extent that server log information is collected by our hosting provider, it may be used for:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
            <li>maintaining the security and integrity of the website;</li>
            <li>monitoring website performance and availability;</li>
            <li>troubleshooting technical issues; and</li>
            <li>complying with legal obligations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-1">We do not use any collected information for marketing, profiling, or selling to third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">5. Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
          <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade personal information. Information may be disclosed to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Hosting provider (AWS):</strong> Amazon Web Services hosts this website. AWS infrastructure is located in the Asia Pacific (Sydney) region but may process data in other AWS regions as part of their global infrastructure. AWS's data handling is governed by their privacy policy and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.</li>
            <li><strong>Law enforcement or regulators:</strong> If required by law, court order, or regulatory request.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">6. Cross-Border Disclosure</h2>
          <p>Our hosting provider (AWS) primarily stores data in Australia (ap-southeast-2 region), but as a global infrastructure provider, AWS may process or transfer data to other countries as part of their service operations. The Tailwind CSS CDN may serve content from servers located outside Australia. By using this website, you acknowledge that limited technical data (such as your IP address) may be processed overseas in connection with these services.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">7. Data Security</h2>
          <p>We take reasonable steps to protect information from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access. The website is served over HTTPS, which encrypts data in transit between your browser and our servers. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>This website is not directed at children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information through this website, please contact us using the details below.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">9. Your Rights</h2>
          <p>Under the Australian Privacy Principles, you have the right to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request access to any personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of any inaccurate personal information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-1">Because this website does not collect personal information through its interactive tools (all data is stored locally in your browser), we are unlikely to hold personal information about you beyond standard server logs. If you wish to exercise your rights, please contact us using the details in section 11.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-slate-900">10. Complaints</h2>
